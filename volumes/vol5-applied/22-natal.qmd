## I. Synastry Overlay Mechanics: The Almuten-to-Hyleg Bridge

### Foundational Principle

When Person A's Almuten Figuris (most dignified planet) aspects or conjoins Person B's Hyleg (life-giving point), Person A's essential governing force directly influences the vitality and life direction of Person B.

### Computational Algorithm

**Step 1:** Calculate both charts completely:
- Person A's Almuten via point-scoring system
- Person B's Hyleg via hierarchical protocol (Sun/Moon in angles → Ascendant → Part of Fortune)

**Step 2:** Assess the aspect relationship:

| Aspect | Base Value |
|--------|------------|
| Conjunction | +5 |
| Trine/Sextile | +3 |
| No aspect | 0 |
| Square | -2 |
| Opposition | -1 |

**Step 3:** Apply modifiers:

```
Almuten-Hyleg Strength = 
    Aspect_Value
  + (Almuten_Dignity_Score ÷ 10)      [yields 0 to +2.5]
  + Almuten_House_Modifier            [angular +2, succedent +1, cadent -1]
  + Hyleg_House_Modifier              [angular +2, succedent +1, cadent -1]
  + Reception_Bonus                   [+1.5 if Almuten in Hyleg's sign dignity]
```

**Final Range:** -2 to +14 (scale to 0-100 for presentation)

### Asymmetry Recognition

The software must calculate **both directions**:
- Person A's Almuten → Person B's Hyleg (A vitalizes B)
- Person B's Almuten → Person A's Hyleg (B vitalizes A)

Present these separately to reveal power dynamics.

### Hierarchical Filtering

Flag when either Hyleg is weak (determined only after Sun/Moon failed to qualify). The Almuten-Hyleg interaction carries greatest weight when both are strongly established.
