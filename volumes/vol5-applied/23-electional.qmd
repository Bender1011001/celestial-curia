# Electional Protocols

## II. Electional Protocols: The Selection Algorithm

### Input Parameters Required

1. **Statement of Intent** — Clear one-sentence description (e.g., "Begin a new business")
2. **Time Window** — Specific dates and hours available
3. **External Constraints** — Appointments, legal requirements, personal obligations

### The Twelve-Step Selection Algorithm

#### Step 1: Establish Significators

| Event Type | Primary Significator | Master Significators |
|------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Business launch | 10th house ruler, Sun | Ascendant ruler, Moon |
| Marriage | 7th house ruler, Venus | Ascendant ruler, Moon |
| Medical procedure | 6th house ruler | Ascendant ruler, Moon |
| Legal action | 9th house ruler, Jupiter | Ascendant ruler, Moon |

#### Step 2: Filter by Lunar Phase

| Event Type | Preferred Phase |
|------------|-----------------|
| Growth, initiation, establishment | Waxing (New → Full) |
| Completion, release, dissolution | Waning (Full → New) |

#### Step 3: Eliminate Void-of-Course Moon

Calculate when Moon perfects its last major aspect before leaving its sign. Eliminate these periods (typically 2-6 hours/day).

#### Step 4: Check Retrograde Status

| Event Type | Avoid Retrograde |
|------------|-----------------|
| Contracts, communication | Mercury |
| Relationships, finances | Venus |
| Action, competition | Mars |

#### Step 5: Evaluate Significator Dignity

Identify times when primary significator occupies essential dignity (domicile, exaltation).

#### Step 6: Assess Angular Placement

Rank times when primary significator occupies angular houses (1st, 4th, 7th, 10th) higher.

#### Step 7: Examine Ascendant Aspects

| Configuration | Ranking |
|---------------|---------|
| Jupiter/Venus conjunct or sextile Ascendant | Optimal |
| No aspects to Ascendant | Neutral |
| Saturn/Mars square or conjunct Ascendant | Suboptimal |

#### Step 8: Evaluate Moon's Aspects to Significator

Moon applying to significator by trine/sextile/conjunction = Most favorable

#### Step 9: Check Sect Compatibility

- **Diurnal charts:** Jupiter and Mars above horizon preferred
- **Nocturnal charts:** Venus and Mars below horizon preferred

#### Step 10: Evaluate Part of Fortune

Ideally angular with well-placed, unafflicted ruler.

#### Step 11: Assess Luminary Dignities

Check Sun (day charts) or Moon (night charts) for essential dignity.

#### Step 12: Synthesize Composite Score

| Factor | Weight |
|--------|--------|
| Significator dignity | 20% |
| Ascendant ruler condition | 20% |
| Angular placements | 15% |
| Moon aspects | 15% |
| Benefic transits | 10% |
| Part of Fortune | 10% |
| Luminaries | 10% |

### Output Format

Present 3-5 optimal time windows ranked by composite score, with explanatory rationale for each.
