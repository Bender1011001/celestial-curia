# Section I: Complete Catalogue of Arabic Parts (Lots)

## 1. Introduction to the Hermetic Lots (Kleroi)

The "Lots" (Greek: *kleroi*; Arabic: *sahm*, pl. *siham*) are mathematical points projected from the Ascendant, derived from the arc between two planetary bodies. They represent the "virtual" or "derived" positions where specific topics (fate, spirit, necessity, marriage) manifest in the life of the native. In the Hellenistic tradition, particularly in Vettius Valens and Paulus Alexandrinus, these points were considered as potent as the planets themselves, often serving as the primary significators for their respective topics.

### Methodology and Sect Usage
The calculation of Lots relies heavily on the **Sect** of the chart (Diurnal vs. Nocturnal).
*   **Diurnal (Day) Formula:** Generally *Ascendant + Planet A - Planet B*.
*   **Nocturnal (Night) Formula:** Generally *Ascendant + Planet B - Planet A* (Reversed).

**Note on Consensus:** While almost all sources (Valens, Paulus, Dorotheus) reverse the Lots of Fortune and Spirit, later Medieval authors (like Bonatti and Ptolemy) occasionally disputed the reversal or simplified the formulas. This catalogue prioritizes the **original Hellenistic logic** (Valens) unless otherwise noted.

## 2. The Seven Hermetic Lots (The Panaretos Integration)

The core system consists of seven Lots associated with the seven planets, detailed by Paulus Alexandrinus (*Introduction*, Ch. 23) and Olympiodorus.

| Lot Name | Planet | Day Formula | Night Formula | Signification & Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Lot of Fortune**<br>*(Tyche)* | Moon | Asc + Moon - Sun | Asc + Sun - Moon | **Body, Chance, Material Manifestation.** The "Lunar Ascendant." Governs the physical vessel, acquisitions, health, and events occurring by chance rather than intent. (Valens Bk II; Paulus Ch 23). |
| **Lot of Spirit**<br>*(Daimon)* | Sun | Asc + Sun - Moon | Asc + Moon - Sun | **Mind, Will, Career, Intent.** The "Solar Ascendant." Governs the intellect, professional reputation (praxis), and actions taken voluntarily. (Valens Bk II; Paulus Ch 23). |
| **Lot of Eros**<br>*(Cupid)* | Venus | Asc + Venus - Spirit | Asc + Spirit - Venus | **Desire, Appetites, Volition.** Governs romantic desire, social relationships, and the drive for union. Often indicates the nature of one's friendships and aesthetic tastes. (Valens Bk II; Paulus Ch 23). |
| **Lot of Necessity**<br>*(Ananke)* | Mercury | Asc + Fortune - Spirit | Asc + Spirit - Fortune | **Constraints, Struggle, Enemies.** Governs what is binding or unavoidable, including enemies, lawsuits, and restrictive circumstances. Often associated with the "root of the matter" in questions of conflict. (Valens Bk II; Paulus Ch 23). |
| **Lot of Courage**<br>*(Tolma)* | Mars | Asc + Fortune - Mars | Asc + Mars - Fortune | **Boldness, Rashness, Enterprise.** Governs military action, bravery, banditry, and acts of daring. Can indicate violence or surgical intervention if afflicted. (Paulus Ch 23). |

## 6. Analytical Summary

### Which Lots Reverse?
In the **Hellenistic** tradition (Valens/Paulus), **almost all Lots reverse by sect** (Day vs. Night). This is because the Lot is a representation of the *planetary arc* relative to the horizon. If the Sun is the "light of the day," the logic holding the Sun as point A vs. Point B shifts when the Moon becomes the "light of the night."
*   **Invariant Lots:** Very few Lots are invariant. The Lot of Basis is technically invariant mathematically (shortest arc), but functionally depends on the positions of Fortune/Spirit which *do* reverse.

### The Hierarchy of Importance
1.  **Fortune & Spirit:** These are Primary. Valens uses Fortune as a second Ascendant (the *Tyche* house system) to derive the "Houses of Fortune."
2.  **Basis & Eros:** Secondary importance for structure and relationships.
3.  **Topic-Specific Lots:** Used only when that specific topic (e.g., "Accusation") is active or inquired about.

### Houses from Fortune
Valens explicitly teaches a technique where the Sign of the Lot of Fortune becomes the **1st House** of a derived chart.
*   **Fortune (1st):** The Body, Life.
*   **10th from Fortune:** The "Praxis" or career (what one actually does).
*   **7th from Fortune:** Partners.
This system often contradicts the Natal Ascendant's indications, revealing the "Lunary" or "Material" layer of fate versus the "Solary" or "Intentional" layer.
