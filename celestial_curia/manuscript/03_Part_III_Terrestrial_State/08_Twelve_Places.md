# Part III: The Terrestrial State

## Chapter 8: The Twelve Places (House Significations)

(Literal Ancient Definitions)
The twelve houses, or Places (Places), were not originally abstract temperamental fields but concrete locations with specific powers (dynamics) and meanings. The following definitions are synthesized from the works of Vettius Valens (Anthology), Firmicus Maternus (Mathesis), and Paulus Alexandrinus.8

	6th

	"Setting" / Descendant
	-
	Marriage, unions, sexual partners, open enemies, lawsuits, death (as the sun dies in the west). The "Other."

	10th

	Jupiter
	Friends, hopes, alliance, patronage, gifts from the King (10th). The most fortunate house, aiding the Ascendant.
	12th

	"Bad Spirit"
	Saturn
	Secret enemies, large animals (beasts of burden), imprisonment, self-undoing, childbirth (labor/suffering), slavery. The place of Saturn's darkness.
	Insight: The assignment of "Joys" follows the sect division. The Diurnal planets (Sun, Jupiter, Saturn) rejoice in the upper/day hemisphere or masculine houses (9th, 11th, 12th—Saturn is in the 12th to mitigate his malice by "darkness"). The Nocturnal planets (Moon, Venus, Mars) rejoice in the lower/night hemisphere or feminine houses (3rd, 5th, 6th). Mercury, neutral, rejoices in the 1st, connecting the two worlds.
