### Bonatti's Considerations: Disqualifying Conditions

—DISQUALIFYING CONDITIONS AS FORENSIC RULES


### A. The Theoretical Foundation: Radicality and Competence


Guido Bonatti's **146 Considerations**, preserved in the *Liber Astronomiae* and translated into English by William Lilly in the 17th century, constitute the most exhaustive compendium of classical astrological conditions determining whether a matter can "come to pass."[13][16][19][22][31][35][45][48][56][59]


Bonatti explicitly established that before interpreting a chart, the astrologer must determine whether the chart is **"radical"**—that is, whether it is suitable for judgment and whether the planets involved are actually competent to manifest their significations.[16][22][31][35][45][48][54][56][59]


As Bonatti himself states in his foundational principle: "All of the Ancients that have wrote of Questions, doe give warning to the Astrologer, that before he deliver judgment he will consider whether the Figure is radicall and capable of judgment."[22][31][54] Radicality is not a guarantee of favorable outcomes—it is the **minimum condition establishing that judgment is even possible**.[16][22][31][35][45][48][54][56][59]


### B. Besiegement: The Trap Between Malefics


**Definition and Operational Meaning**


**Besiegement** (also called "enclosure") describes a condition wherein a planet **separates from one malefic and applies to another malefic** without receiving assistance from either.[14][17][35] The besieged planet is, metaphorically, **"between a rock and a hard place"**—facing inescapable opposition from two directions.[14][17][35]


Bonatti is explicit: "A planet is besieged when it separates from one of the malefics and applies to the other. In besiegement only the conjunction, square and opposition are considered. Just like a besieged city, the planet in this condition is in serious trouble which will be difficult to escape."[14][17]


**The Critical Condition: Lack of Reception**


The debilitating effect of besiegement depends absolutely on **whether the besieged planet receives protection through reception** (being in a sign ruled by one of the malefics).[14][17][35] Without reception, besiegement is essentially **unmitigated**—the planet has no refuge, no support, no escape.[14][17][35]


As classical sources articulate: "All that is related to, and signified by, the besieged planet will encounter difficulty and impediment."[14][17] If the besieged planet is the Moon (significator of the body and health), the native faces health crises. If the besieged planet rules the 1st house (the native's self), the native's identity is under siege. If the besieged planet is the significator of the matter asked about, the matter itself becomes impossible to accomplish.[14][17][35]


**Historical Case Study: Marie Antoinette**


In Marie Antoinette's nativity, the **Moon is besieged**—separating from a square with Mars and applying to a square with Saturn, all without reception to mitigate the pressure.[14] The Moon, in this configuration, signifies the Queen's person and her capacity for emotional stability and prudent judgment. The besiegement between Mars (aggression, revolutionary fervor) and Saturn (restriction, authority challenged) resulted in exactly what Bonatti's rule predicts: the native's **identity and person under siege, ultimately destroyed by the gap between oppressive authority and revolutionary violence** she could not escape.[14]


### C. The Void of Course Moon: The Disconnection That Prevents Completion


**Classical Definition: The Hellenistic Understanding**


The **Void of Course Moon** represents one of the most misunderstood conditions in modern astrology, with contemporary interpretation diverging sharply from classical (Hellenistic) understanding.[15][39][42] 


In the **Hellenistic definition** (from the Greek *kenodromia*, "running in the void" or "running in the emptiness"), the Moon is void of course when it **will not complete any Ptolemaic aspect within the following 30 degrees of its journey, regardless of sign boundary.**[15][39][42] This creates a condition of profound **isolation and lack of connection** to the broader astrological pattern.[15][39][42]


The Hellenistic void is distinct from the modern definition, which focuses on sign boundaries. The Hellenistic definition is far more rare—occurring roughly once every three days—yet far more potent when it occurs.[15][39][42]


**The Principle: Disconnection Prevents Manifestation**


Bonatti articulates the principle directly: The Moon is "the School-mistress of all things" and "the Bringer-down of all the Planet's influences" and functions as a kind of "internuncio" (intermediary) between planets, "carrying their virtues from one to the other."[19][45][48][56][59]


When the Moon is void of course, **this intermediary function ceases**. The planets cannot communicate their intentions to one another; their influences cannot be transmitted to the native; matters being asked about cannot progress because the Moon—the primary agent of manifestation in the terrestrial realm—is isolated and impotent.[15][19][39][42][45][48][56][59]


**Why Modern Practice Differs**


Contemporary horary astrology adopted the practice of avoiding void of course Moons entirely, treating the condition as an automatic disqualification. However, Bonatti himself was less absolute. He notes that "All manner of matters goe hardly on (except the principall significators be very strong) when the Moon is voyd of course; yet somewhat she performes if voyd of course, and be either in Taurus, Cancer, Sagittarius or Pisces."[22][51]


Bonatti's subtlety reveals the classical view: **Void of course is a serious impediment, but not necessarily an absolute disqualification.** If the principal significators (the planets ruling the matter being asked) are very well placed and dignified, the matter can still come to pass—but it will encounter significant obstacles, delays, and complications.[15][22][39][42][51]


### D. Additional Critical Considerations: The Red Flag System


Beyond besiegement and void of course, Bonatti identified numerous other conditions that disqualify judgment or render matters unlikely to come to pass:[13][16][19][22][31][35][45][48][54][56][59]


**Saturn in the 1st or 7th House (the Astrologer's Impairment):**


When Saturn occupies the 1st house (astrologer's self-representation in horary) or 7th house (the astrologer specifically in horary practice), the astrologer's **judgment becomes corrupted or unreliable.**[22][31][45][48][54] The astrologer either lacks competence to judge properly, harbors unconscious bias, or is personally compromised in understanding the matter.[22][31][45][48][54] As Bonatti notes: "If Saturn be in the Ascendant, especially Retrograde, the matter of that Question seldome or never comes good" and "Saturn in the seventh either corrupts the judgment of the Astrologer, or is a Signe the matter propounded will come from one misfortune to another."[22][31][45][48][51][54]


**The Lord of the Ascendant (or Significator) in its Detriment or Fall without Reception:**


When the planet ruling the matter (the significator) or the planet ruling the ascendant (the querent) is positioned in its detriment (opposite sign to its domicile) or fall (opposite sign to its exaltation) **without reception** (without being in a sign ruled by a benefic), the planet cannot properly execute its function.[16][22][31][35][45][48][54][59] Bonatti states: "And if it be an Infortune, though they do not give him virtue, yet without a reception it will not do; but with a reception, if he be not afflicted, it signifies a good end of the matter, though not without much labour and tediousness."[45][48][56]


**The Moon in the Via Combusta (15° Libra to 15° Scorpio):**


The **Via Combusta** ("the burning way") represents an area of the zodiac where both luminaries are debilitated—the Sun in its fall (Libra) and the Moon in its fall (Scorpio).[37][40][51] When the Moon occupies this region, it suffers dual debilitation and cannot properly transmit influence to bring matters to fruition.[37][40][51] Bonatti notes: "It's not safe to judge when the Moon is in the later degrees of a Signe, especially in Gemini, Scorpio or Capricorn; or as some say she is in Via Combusta, which is, when she is in the last 15 degrees of Libra, or the first fifteen degrees of Scorpio."[22][51]


**Early or Late Ascendant Degrees (3° or less, or 27°+):**


An ascendant in the first 3 degrees of a sign suggests the **question is premature**—the matter is not yet ripe for judgment because conditions haven't properly formed.[22][31][45][48][54] An ascendant in the last 3 degrees (27°-30°) suggests the **question is too late**—the matter is essentially concluded and judgment cannot change what has already happened.[22][31][45][48][54] Bonatti: "If 27, 28 or 29 degrees ascend of any Signe, it's no wayes safe to give judgment, except the Querent be of years corresponding to the number of degrees ascending."[22][51]


### E. The Integration Model: How Bonatti's Considerations Work Together


**The Sequential Analysis Protocol**


Classical astrologers employing Bonatti's system would **check conditions in a specific sequence**, progressively ruling out matters unfit for judgment:[16][22][31][35][45][48][54][56][59]


**First Filter: Radicality Checks**


1. Is the hour lord the same as the Ascendant ruler, or are they in the same triplicity? (If not, the question lacks synchronization and may not be "radical")
2. Is Saturn in the 1st or 7th? (If yes, the astrologer's judgment is suspect)
3. Are the testimonies of fortunes and infortunes equal? (If yes, the outcome cannot be determined)


**Second Filter: Impediment Checks**


4. Is the significator in detriment or fall without reception? (If yes, it cannot properly execute)
5. Is the Ascendant in early (0-3°) or late (27-30°) degrees? (If yes, the timing is wrong)
6. Is the Moon void of course AND are the principal significators weak? (If yes, manifestation is prevented)


**Third Filter: Specific Debilitations**


7. Is the significator besieged between malefics without reception? (If yes, it is inescapably trapped)
8. Is the Moon in the Via Combusta? (If yes, transmission is blocked)
9. Is the significator retrograde and afflicted simultaneously? (If yes, it cannot manifest)


**Only if the chart passes all three filter levels can the astrologer proceed to judgment with reasonable confidence that the planets involved are actually competent to manifest their significations.**[16][22][31][35][45][48][54][56][59]

### The Nature of Aspects

The Thema Mundi provides the geometric proof for why aspects are considered "Benefic" or "Malefic." The nature of an aspect is derived from the relationship of the planets to the Luminaries (Sun and Moon) in this chart.
1. The Opposition (180°): In the Thema Mundi, the Moon (Cancer) and Saturn (Capricorn) are in opposition. Because Saturn is the Greater Malefic, the nature of the opposition is Saturnine—cold, separative, blocking, and hostile.
2. The Square (90°): The Sun (Leo) and Mars (Scorpio) are in a square. (Also Moon to Venus/Aries, but the Sun/Mars square is primary). Because Mars is the Lesser Malefic, the square is Martian—sharp, heated, contentious, and energetic.
3. The Trine (120°): The Sun (Leo) and Jupiter (Sagittarius) are in a trine. Because Jupiter is the Greater Benefic, the trine is Jovian—supportive, expansive, flowing, and stable.
4. The Sextile (60°): The Sun (Leo) and Venus (Libra) are in a sextile. Because Venus is the Lesser Benefic, the sextile is Venusian—harmonious, unifying, and pleasant.
5. The Inconjunct (Aversion): Planets in the 2nd, 6th, 8th, and 12th houses from the Ascendant in the Thema Mundi (Leo, Sagittarius, Aquarius, Gemini relative to Cancer) create complex relationships. While the Sun is in the 2nd, it "sees" the Moon by proximity. However, Saturn (7th) is in opposition to the Ascendant, signifying the enemy or death. The 6th (Jupiter) and 8th (Aquarius/Saturn) are in aversion, contributing to the "evil" reputation of these houses as places where the Ascendant cannot "see" or manage affairs.7
