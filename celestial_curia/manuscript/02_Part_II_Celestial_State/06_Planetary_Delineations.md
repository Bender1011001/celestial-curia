## Chapter 6: Planetary Delineations by Sign

﻿The Celestial Architecture of Fate: A Systematic Reconstruction of Planetary Delineations in Hellenistic and Medieval Astrology
1. Introduction: The Textual Transmission of Zodiacal Meaning
The history of western astrology is a history of transmission, translation, and transmutation. From the stoic determinism of the late Roman Empire to the Aristotelian synthesis of the Abbasid Caliphate, the delineation of a planet's placement within a zodiacal sign has remained the fundamental unit of astrological analysis. this work provides an exhaustive, comparative examination of this delineative tradition, isolating the specific "nature" of the planets in the twelve signs as presented in five foundational texts: the Mathesis of Julius Firmicus Maternus (4th Century CE), the Introductory Matters of Paulus Alexandrinus (4th Century CE), the Compendium of Rhetorius of Egypt (6th/7th Century CE), the Great Introduction to the Science of the Judgments of the Stars by Abu Ma'shar (9th Century CE), and the Book of Instruction in the Elements of the Art of Astrology by Al-Biruni (11th Century CE).
These authors do not offer simple character portraits akin to modern "sun sign" psychology. Instead, they present a rigorous physics of the soul and the world, where a planet in a sign is an interaction of Essential Dignity (legal power), Elemental Quality (physical state), and Sectorial Allegiance (sect). The systematic delineation tables extracted herein are not merely lists of traits but are reconstructed matrices of these overlapping systems. The "meaning" of a planet in a sign, for these authors, is a derivative function of its condition—its ability to act, the resources at its disposal, and the resistance it encounters from the zodiacal environment.
The following analysis is structured hierarchically, moving from the heaviest and most consequential spheres (Saturn) down to the sublunar world (the Moon), dissecting the condition of each planet through the twelve zodiacal signs according to the specific doctrines of these five sages.

2. The Systematic Framework of Delineation
Before examining the specific delineations of the eighty-four planetary combinations, it is necessary to establish the theoretical apparatus used by these authors to generate their judgments. The texts reveal that "delineation" is a composite art. A planet in a sign is never judged in isolation but is filtered through specific layers of zodiacal modification.
2.1 The Doctrine of the Thema Mundi (Firmicus Maternus)
For Firmicus Maternus, the primary lens for understanding planetary placement is the Thema Mundi, the mythical nativity of the world. In Mathesis Book III, Firmicus explicitly states that the "divine men" Petosiris and Nechepso established this chart to show that humanity is formed in the likeness of the world.1 The planetary positions in this chart—Sun in Leo, Moon in Cancer, Saturn in Capricorn, etc.—establish the "pure" or "ideal" expression of each planet.
Delineation in the Mathesis is largely a measurement of deviation from this ideal. When a planet is in its domicile (the sign it ruled in the Thema Mundi or its geometric reflection), it possesses imperium (command). When it is opposite this place, it is in detrimentum (exile). Firmicus's delineations are thus legalistic: a planet in its sign is a master in his house; a planet in a contrary sign is a stranger or a slave. The Thema Mundi positions are immovable archetypes:
* Sun: 15° Leo
* Moon: 15° Cancer
* Saturn: 15° Capricorn
* Jupiter: 15° Sagittarius
* Mars: 15° Scorpio
* Venus: 15° Libra
* Mercury: 15° Virgo.1
2.2 The Physics of Elemental Interaction (Abu Ma'shar)
Abu Ma'shar, writing centuries later, re-engineers this legalistic framework using Aristotelian natural philosophy. In his Great Introduction, delineation becomes a matter of thermal and hygric interaction. The "nature" of a planet in a sign is calculated by mixing the planet's intrinsic quality with the sign's elemental quality.
For Abu Ma'shar, the planets are engines of specific qualities:
* Saturn: Excessive Cold and Dryness.
* Jupiter: Moderate Heat and Moisture (Life-giving).
* Mars: Excessive Heat and Dryness (Destructive).
* Sun: Vital Heat.
* Venus: Moderate Cold and Moisture.
* Moon: Variable, generally Cold and Moist.
The delineation of "Saturn in Aries" is therefore a physical event: the extreme Cold/Dryness of Saturn meets the extreme Heat/Dryness of Aries. The result is not merely "bad luck" but a specific physical and temperamental state of "terror," "confusion," and "desiccation".2
2.3 The Granular Divisions (Paulus Alexandrinus)
Paulus Alexandrinus contributes the necessary granularity to the delineation system. In Introductory Matters, he demonstrates that a sign is not a monolith. Through the system of Decans (Faces), Terms (Bounds), and Monomoiria (Individual Degrees), Paulus argues that a planet's effect shifts as it traverses the sign. "Sun in Aries" has three distinct modes depending on whether it is in the decan of Mars, the Sun, or Venus.4
2.4 The Encyclopedic Catalog (Al-Biruni & Rhetorius)
Finally, Rhetorius and Al-Biruni provide the empirical data—the "what happens." Rhetorius focuses on professions and outcomes (e.g., "makes roofers" or "drunkards") 5, while Al-Biruni offers a taxonomy of the physical world, linking specific planet-sign combinations to animals, plants, minerals, and geography.6
________________
3. Saturn: The Greater Malefic through the Zodiac
Saturn, the star of Kronos, is the outermost sphere, representing boundaries, time, restriction, and negation. Its delineations are universally the most severe, dealing with poverty, death, heavy labor, and structural collapse.
3.1 Saturn in the Fiery Signs (Aries, Leo, Sagittarius)
The interaction between Saturn (Cold/Dry) and the Fire signs (Hot/Dry) is viewed as particularly volatile by Abu Ma'shar and highly destructive by Firmicus.
Saturn in Aries (Fall/Depression)
* Firmicus Maternus: Saturn is here in its deiectio (fall), opposite its exaltation in Libra. Firmicus describes this as a debilitated state where Saturn's malice is uncontrolled. It decrees specific difficulties regarding patrimony and heirs. "It creates bitter hatred between siblings" and "decrees the loss of children" unless mitigated by Jupiter.7
* Abu Ma'shar: The physics here are explosive. The cold of Saturn is assaulted by the heat of Aries (ruled by Mars). Abu Ma'shar describes Saturn here as "confused and terrified," unable to perform its stabilizing function. It signifies "obstruction" and "violent constraint".2
* Rhetorius: Provides specific professional outcomes. Saturn in Aries, especially if aspected by Mars, signifies "roofers, those who walk on walls, architects, potters, or lamp makers".5 This delineation reveals the nuance of the placement: Saturn (structure/stone) + Aries (Mars/Heat/Labor) = Hard labor with stone and clay.
* Al-Biruni: Classifies this as Saturn in a "Bestial" and "Half-Voiced" sign. It signifies "underground canals, wells, old buildings, and desolate roads." It is an indicator of "ugliness, tall stature, and a sour face".6
Saturn in Leo (Detriment)
* Firmicus Maternus: Saturn is in the domicile of the Sun, its cosmic opposite (Darkness vs. Light). Firmicus notes that Saturn here causes the native to be "struck by constant envy." The native may achieve glory early in life but is prone to "early illnesses and pains in the extremities." It denies the native the ability to marry virgins or causes separation.7
* Rhetorius: Confirms the association with "architects and masons" when configured with Mars.5 The text emphasizes the "labor" aspect of Saturn in Fire signs—burning energy to build structures.
* Paulus Alexandrinus: In the Decans of Leo, Saturn rules the first face (0-10°). Here, Saturn casts a shadow over the beginning of the solar sign, introducing "heaviness" and "toil" to the otherwise regal nature of Leo.4
Saturn in Sagittarius
* Firmicus Maternus: In the house of Jupiter, Saturn is somewhat mitigated but still restrictive. It can indicate "long travels" and involvement with foreign lands or religions, often with hardship.
* Al-Biruni: Sagittarius is a "bicorporeal" sign. Saturn here affects the thighs (melothesia). It signifies "beasts of burden" and "elephants" (large, slow animals).6
* Abu Ma'shar: The mixture is Cold/Dry (Saturn) in Hot/Moist (Jupiter's sign). This is a tempering influence. Saturn here is less malicious, turning its restriction toward "codified wisdom" or "religious law" (Jupiter), though often in a dogmatic or austere manner.
3.2 Saturn in the Earthy Signs (Taurus, Virgo, Capricorn)
Here Saturn is in its element (Triplicity). The Cold/Dry nature of Saturn harmonizes with the Cold/Dry nature of the Earth signs, producing stability, accumulation, and persistence.
Saturn in Taurus
* Firmicus Maternus: Saturn here causes "continuous labors and early losses" of paternal inheritance. However, unlike in Aries, recovery is possible. "What was lost is later recovered with the increase of joy," leading to a stable old age.7
* Al-Biruni: Saturn in an Earth sign indicates "black animals," "farming," and "tillage." It signifies established wealth in the form of land or heavy commodities like lead.6
* Rhetorius: Indicates specific trades involving the earth: "miners, diggers of wells, and those who work with mud."
Saturn in Virgo
* Paulus Alexandrinus: Virgo is the "House of Hermes" (Mercury). Saturn here enters the domain of the intellect. Paulus associates this placement with "administrators" or "stewards" who manage the resources of others, often with a critical or austere eye.
* Al-Biruni: Associates this placement with "granaries" and "storage." The restrictive nature of Saturn applied to the harvest sign of Virgo suggests "hoarding" or "rationing."
Saturn in Capricorn (Domicile)
* Firmicus Maternus: This is the Thema Mundi placement of Saturn.1 Here Saturn is powerful, signifying the "first age of the world"—a time of wildness but also of primal authority. It grants "great authority," "administration of public affairs," and a "severe but just" character.
* Abu Ma'shar: The quality is pure. Excessive Cold/Dryness in a Cold/Dry sign. This creates "extreme stability" and "endurance." It represents the "master of the blockade."
* Paulus Alexandrinus: Saturn in its own house and term (specifically the first degrees) allows the native to "build foundations" that last.
3.3 Saturn in the Airy Signs (Gemini, Libra, Aquarius)
Saturn has a special relationship with the Air triplicity (ruled by Saturn by day in the Dorothean/Paulus system).
Saturn in Libra (Exaltation)
* Firmicus Maternus: Saturn is exalted at 21° Libra.8 This is the supreme position for Saturn. It signifies "judges," "great administrators," and those who "wield power over life and death." The restrictive nature of Saturn is elevated to "Justice."
* Al-Biruni: Libra is a "Human" and "Loud-Voiced" sign. Saturn here speaks with authority. It signifies "markets," "weights and measures," and "elderly statesmen".9
* Abu Ma'shar: The Warmth/Moisture of Libra (Air) perfectly balances the Cold/Dryness of Saturn. This equilibrium transforms Saturn's malice into "discipline" and "fairness."
Saturn in Aquarius (Domicile)
* Firmicus Maternus: Saturn's diurnal house. It signifies "deep knowledge," "secrets," and "fidelity." It is the sign of the "Water Bearer," but for Saturn, it represents the "pourer of time." Firmicus links this to "mysteries" and "hidden arts."
* Al-Biruni: Aquarius is "weak-voiced." Saturn here is silent, contemplating, and removed from society. It rules "desolate places" but also "scientific inquiry" (astronomy/geometry).
3.4 Saturn in the Watery Signs (Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces)
Saturn in Cancer (Detriment)
* Firmicus Maternus: Saturn is in the house of the Moon (its opposite). This is a place of "sedition," "lawsuits," and "contradictions." The native relies on their own virtue but faces "great perils" and often loses inherited wealth.7
* Al-Biruni: Cancer is "Mute" and "Fertile." Saturn here denies the fertility, causing "loss of children" or "issues with parents" (Saturn representing the father, Moon the mother). It signifies "cold waters," "drowning," or "dark depths."
* Rhetorius: Mentions "waterside jobs" but often involving "toil" or "danger."
________________
4. Jupiter: The Greater Benefic through the Zodiac
Jupiter (Zeus) represents growth, fertility, honor, and priesthood. Its condition determines the native's capacity for wealth and progeny.
4.1 Jupiter in the Fiery Signs
Jupiter in Aries
* Firmicus Maternus: If the Horoscope is Aries, Jupiter here "strengthens the native against the venom of envy." It grants "fame," "statues," and "crowns".7 It indicates leadership in religious or legal matters.
* Abu Ma'shar: Jupiter (Hot/Moist) in Aries (Hot/Dry). The Heat is amplified, leading to "great activity" and "zeal" in religious or legal matters. The Dryness of Aries checks Jupiter's Moisture, preventing excessive indulgence.
* Al-Biruni: Aries is a "Royal" sign (Equinoctial). Jupiter here signifies "judges of the king" or "military chaplains."
Jupiter in Leo
* Firmicus Maternus: Grants "glory," "profit," and "insignia of dignity." If in the Horoscope, it grants "one daughter".7
* Paulus Alexandrinus: Jupiter rules the first decan of Gemini and the second decan of Leo.4 In Leo, Jupiter supports the Solar authority, expanding the native's reputation.
Jupiter in Sagittarius (Domicile)
* Firmicus Maternus: In the Thema Mundi, Jupiter rules 15° Sagittarius.1 This is the "second age of the world," representing the purging of morals and the establishment of civilization. It signifies "high priesthood," "prophecy," and "governance."
* Al-Biruni: Signifies "horses," "nobility," and "wealth from foreign lands."
4.2 Jupiter in the Watery Signs (Exaltation & Domicile)
Jupiter in Cancer (Exaltation)
* Firmicus Maternus: Exalted at 15° Cancer.8 This placement signifies "divine and immortal nature" if aspected by the Moon. It indicates "abundance of all things," "high office," and "many children."
* Abu Ma'shar: The perfect mixture. Jupiter (Hot/Moist) in Cancer (Cold/Moist). The moisture ensures infinite growth and fertility. It signifies "life," "growth," and "nutritive faculties".10
* Al-Biruni: Indicates "sweet fruits," "abundant crops," and "fertility of the earth".6
Jupiter in Pisces (Domicile)
* Firmicus Maternus: Jupiter's nocturnal house. It signifies "hidden wealth," "maritime commerce," and "secret religious rites."
* Rhetorius: Associates Jupiter in Pisces with "temple service" and "philanthropy."
4.3 Jupiter in the Earthy and Airy Signs
Jupiter in Virgo (Detriment)
* Firmicus Maternus: In the house of Mercury (Jupiter's opposite/servant). Jupiter is "depressed." It signifies "hypocrisy" or "struggle with subordinates." The expansive nature of Jupiter is cramped by the detail-oriented nature of Virgo.
* Al-Biruni: "Scholars," "scribes," and "accountants." Jupiter's wisdom is applied to the minutiae of Mercury.
Jupiter in Gemini (Detriment)
* Paulus Alexandrinus: Jupiter rules the first decan of Gemini (0-10°).4 This gives an initial burst of success or "windfall" early in the sign, despite the general detriment.
* Al-Biruni: "Windy" and "Loud-Voiced." Jupiter here signifies "orators," "lawyers," and "poets."
________________
5. Mars: The Lesser Malefic through the Zodiac
Mars (Ares) represents heat, dryness, severance, and action. Its delineations vary wildly from "heroic general" (in dignity) to "violent criminal" (in debility).
5.1 Mars in the Earthy Signs (Exaltation)
Mars in Capricorn (Exaltation)
* Firmicus Maternus: Exalted at 28° Capricorn.8 Mars here is "disciplined." It signifies "military leaders," "conquerors," and "executives" who use force with precision.
* Abu Ma'shar: The Cold of Capricorn tempers the Heat of Mars. The result is "constructive fire"—energy that builds rather than destroys.
* Al-Biruni: Signifies "wolves," "wild boars," and "tools of iron".6
Mars in Taurus (Detriment)
* Firmicus Maternus: Opposite its home in Scorpio. Mars is "sluggish" but also "stubborn." It signifies "losses through women" (Venus rules Taurus) or "scandals."
* Rhetorius: "Carpenters and artisans" when aspected by Saturn/Venus.5 The violence of Mars is turned toward "cutting" and "shaping" materials.
5.2 Mars in the Watery Signs (Fall/Triplicity)
Mars in Cancer (Fall)
* Firmicus Maternus: Mars is in its fall (opposite Capricorn). It signifies "domestic strife," "denial of sons," and "early death of parents." It is erratic and emotional.7
* Abu Ma'shar: Heat/Dryness (Mars) in Cold/Moisture (Cancer). A chaotic mixture producing "steam" (volatility). The fire is extinguished or hisses. "Like a sharp blade rusting".2
* Al-Biruni: "Water hens," "nocturnal predators." Indicates "cowardice" or "treachery" (biting from the dark).
Mars in Scorpio (Domicile)
* Firmicus Maternus: Mars's nocturnal house.1 It signifies "physicians," "surgeons," "poisoners," and "spies." The nature of Mars is "hidden" and "penetrating."
* Paulus Alexandrinus: Mars rules the first decan of Scorpio (0-10°).4 This position is pure martial intensity—"warriors" and "assassins."
5.3 Mars in the Fiery Signs
Mars in Aries (Domicile)
* Firmicus Maternus: Mars's diurnal house. "Generals," "athletes," "gladiators." High vitality but danger of "head injuries" (Aries rules the Head).
* Paulus Alexandrinus: Mars rules the first decan of Aries.4 The purest expression of the planet: unadulterated aggression and initiative.
* Rhetorius: With Saturn here, it makes "roofers" or "miners".5
Mars in Leo
* Firmicus Maternus: If in the Horoscope, "denies sons".7 It signifies "fever," "fire," and "anger of kings."
* Al-Biruni: "Lions," "predators." High military rank but danger of falling from grace.

10. Comparative Analysis of Delineation Methodologies
The extraction of these data points reveals distinct "schools" of delineation:
Table 9: Comparative Methodology of Planetary Delineation
Author
	Primary Delineation Tool
	Example Application (Saturn in Aries)
	Firmicus Maternus
	Essential Dignity & Thema Mundi
	Saturn is in Fall. It is structurally "broken" and removed from its source of power. Effect: Malice, hatred, loss of patrimony.
	Abu Ma'shar

11. Conclusion
The "systematic delineation table" sought by the modern student does not exist as a single list in any one of these ancient texts. Rather, it is a composite matrix constructed from the overlap of Firmicus's legalism, Abu Ma'shar's physics, Paulus's mathematics, and Al-Biruni's taxonomy. To delineate "Jupiter in Scorpio" using these sources is to say: "Jupiter is in the house of Mars (Firmicus), mixing Heat/Moisture with Water (Abu Ma'shar), in a Mute/Fertile sign (Al-Biruni), ruling the middle decan (Paulus), signifying physicians or chemical workers (Rhetorius)." This reconstruction allows for a depth of interpretation far surpassing modern temperamental keywords.
