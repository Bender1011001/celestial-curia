## Chapter 14: Zodiacal Releasing (Aphesis)

The Macroscopic Architecture


**Definition:** Zodiacal Releasing divides the entire human lifespan into **successive chapters** beginning from the Lot of Spirit (career/direction) or Lot of Fortune (health/circumstance), with each chapter spanning a number of years determined by the sign's ruling planet's synodic cycle.[19][21][22][43][50]


**The Principle:**[19][21][22][50]


Once you locate the **Lot of Spirit** (for career/life direction analysis), you identify its zodiacal sign. That sign becomes the **first chapter** of life. Each zodiacal sign is attributed a fixed number of years:


- **Aries/Scorpio:** 15 years each (Mars cycle)
- **Taurus/Libra:** 8 years each (Venus cycle)
- **Gemini/Virgo:** 20 years each (Mercury cycle)
- **Cancer:** 25 years (Moon cycle)
- **Leo:** 19 years (Sun cycle)
- **Sagittarius/Pisces:** 12 years each (Jupiter cycle)
- **Capricorn:** 27 years (Saturn cycle)
- **Aquarius:** 30 years (Saturn/modern Uranus)


**Example:** A native with **Lot of Spirit in Taurus** experiences:
- Ages 0-8: **Taurus chapter** (Venus as chronocrator) = themes of relationships, values, material foundation
- Ages 8-28: **Gemini chapter** (Mercury as chronocrator, 20 years) = themes of communication, learning, flexibility
- Ages 28-53: **Cancer chapter** (Moon as chronocrator, 25 years) = themes of emotion, family, introspection
- Ages 53-72: **Leo chapter** (Sun as chronocrator, 19 years) = themes of creativity, authority, public recognition
- And so forth through the remaining signs


**The Extraordinary Implication:** A person born with Lot of Spirit in Capricorn (27 years) followed by Aquarius (30 years) will not even reach their third life chapter until age 57, while someone with Lot of Spirit in Taurus (8 years) followed by Gemini (20 years) reaches their third chapter at only 28. **The structure of life's chapters is literally written into the zodiacal position of the Lot at birth.**[19][21][22][50]

### The Loosing of the Bond

—RUPTURE AND REVERSAL


### A. Definition and Mechanism


The **"Loosing of the Bond"** (also called the **"breaking of the sequence"**) represents one of the most dramatic and precise phenomena in classical astrology.[8][25][51][52][54]


**Definition:** When a **Zodiacal Releasing period** at Level 1 (or Level 2) extends longer than approximately 17.5 years, the sub-periods (Level 2 or Level 3) will eventually complete a full cycle through all twelve zodiacal signs and return to where they began. At this point, instead of **repeating** the sequence from the beginning, the system **jumps to the opposite sign** and continues from there. This dramatic reversal is the "Loosing of the Bond."[19][25][51][52]


**Which Signs Produce a Loosing of the Bond?**


Only the planets with **great years exceeding 17.5 years** can produce a Loosing of the Bond:[19][25][51][52]


- **Mercury:** 20 years (Gemini, Virgo)
- **Moon:** 25 years (Cancer)
- **Sun:** 19 years (Leo)
- **Saturn:** 27 years (Capricorn), 30 years (Aquarius)


Venus (8 years), Mars (15 years), and Jupiter (12 years) do NOT produce a Loosing of the Bond because their periods are shorter than 17.5 years.


### B. How the Loosing of the Bond Manifests


**Concrete Example (from Source [19][25]):**


A native has **Lot of Fortune in Cancer** (Moon's 25-year period). At Level 2, the sub-periods cycle through the zodiac in order: Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius, Pisces, Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer (completing the cycle), Leo, Virgo... 


However, when the 25-month sub-period sequence has cycled through all twelve signs once (approximately 17+ years into the main Cancer period), instead of continuing with a **second Cancer sub-period**, the system **jumps to the opposite sign (Capricorn)** and continues from there.


The sequence becomes: ...Gemini, **[LOOSING OF THE BOND]**, Capricorn, Aquarius, Pisces, etc.


**Timing:** For a 25-year Cancer period, the Loosing of the Bond occurs approximately **17 years into the period**, marking a profound threshold.[19][25][51]


### C. Astrological Significance: The Mechanism for Major Life Reversals


The Loosing of the Bond is universally understood as a **major turning point or threshold in the life**, particularly regarding the **Lot from which one is releasing.**[8][25][51][52][54]


**For Zodiacal Releasing from the Lot of Spirit** (career/life direction):


The Loosing of the Bond marks a **major career transition or fundamental shift in life direction**. Historical examples include:[51][54]


- **Arnold Schwarzenegger:** Loosing of the Bond when he transitioned from professional bodybuilding to acting, and again when he transitioned from acting to political office (California governor)
- **Venus Williams:** Loosing of the Bond periods coinciding with pivotal career decisions and competitive victories


**For Zodiacal Releasing from the Lot of Fortune** (health/circumstances):


The Loosing of the Bond marks a **dramatic shift in health status, financial circumstances, or life conditions**.[8][25][51]


**For Zodiacal Releasing from other Lots** (Eros, Nemesis, Basis):


The Loosing of the Bond marks significant transitions in the domains of **relationships, challenges, or material sustainability**, respectively.[8][25][51]


### D. The Pre-Loosing and Post-Loosing Phases


Research by contemporary astrologers has identified a **three-phase structure around the Loosing of the Bond:**[25][51]


**Phase 1—The "Foreshadowing" Period (1-2 years before):**
The sub-period immediately preceding the Loosing of the Bond—the one that will mirror or foreshadow what the Loosing of the Bond itself will bring. This period acts as a "**laying of the foundation**" phase where the themes that will crystallize in the Loosing of the Bond begin to emerge.[25][51]


**Phase 2—The Loosing of the Bond Itself (variable duration, typically 1-2 years):**
The actual threshold moment. Major life transitions occur. Decisions are made. Reversals happen. The life narrative shifts direction.[25][51]


**Phase 3—The Continuation Phase (years following):**
After the Loosing of the Bond, the new direction solidifies. The native consolidates changes and develops the new trajectory established during the Loosing of the Bond.[25][51]


**Example from Anthony Louis (Source [54]):**


The astrologer Anthony Louis received a major award for his horary astrology textbook. By analyzing Zodiacal Releasing, he found that:


- **August 1989:** Loosing of the Bond when he **submitted the book proposal** to the publisher
- **January 1991:** Another Loosing of the Bond when the **book was published**
- **April 1992:** Level 4 Loosing of the Bond (in Cancer, his 10th house of career) exactly during the week he **received the award** at the United Astrology Congress


The precision of this timing illustrates how the Loosing of the Bond functions as a **deterministic trigger for major life events**.[54]
