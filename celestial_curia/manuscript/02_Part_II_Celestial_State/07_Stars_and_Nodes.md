## Chapter 7: The Fixed Stars and Lunar Nodes

### The Lunar Nodes (Caput et Cauda Draconis)



## 1. The Nature of the Nodes in Traditional Astrology

In the traditional framework (Hellenistic to Renaissance), the Lunar Nodes are not merely points of connection but are treated as quasi-planetary powers derived from the interaction of the Sun and Moon.

*   **North Node (Caput Draconis / The Head):** Nature of **Jupiter and Venus**. It is energetic, expanding, increasing, and generally benefic, but chaotic. It amplifies the nature of any planet it touches. In medieval texts (Bonatti), it is deemed "Good with the Good, and Bad with the Bad" (increasing the scope of whatever it touches), but generally favorable.
*   **South Node (Cauda Draconis / The Tail):** Nature of **Saturn and Mars**. It is constrictive, decreasing, purging, and generally malefic. It suppresses or diminishes the nature of planets conjoined to it.
*   **The Eclipses & Bendings:**
    *   **Eclipses:** Occur when New/Full Moons are within ~12-18° of the Nodes. These are "System Restarts" or major omens affecting the nations ruled by the signs involved.
    *   **The Bendings:** Planets **square** the Nodal Axis are said to be "at the Bendings." This is a condition of extreme instability and critical crisis, as the planet is equidistant from the points of eclipse.
