## Chapter 12: The Calculus of Vitality — Hyleg and Alcocoden

—HYLEG AND ALCOCODEN


### A. Theoretical Framework: Determining the Giver of Life


The **Hyleg** (also spelled **Hilaj** or **Hyleg**) represents the **planet or point with the greatest essential dignity in the five hylegical points**—much like the Almuten Figuris, but calculated specifically to determine **vitality and longevity** rather than general temperament.[2][5][7][8][10][26][29][35]


The term **"Hyleg"** derives from the Middle Persian **"hîlâk,"** meaning "nativity" or "life-giver."[29] The Hyleg functions as the **significator of the native's vital force**—the celestial representative of the body's capacity to sustain life.


**Hylegical House Requirements:**


Critically, the Hyleg must not only have high dignity at the five hylegical points but must also be positioned in a **hylegical house** (places of strength and visibility):


**Acceptable Hylegical Houses** (per Ptolemy):
- 1st house (Ascendant and 5° above)
- 10th house (Midheaven)
- 11th house
- 9th house
- 7th house


**Unacceptable Houses:**
- 8th house (death house)
- 12th house (hidden, isolated)
- 6th house (service, illness)
- Any house below the horizon (except 5° above the 1st)


If neither the **Sun** (in diurnal charts) nor the **Moon** (in nocturnal charts) qualifies as Hyleg due to house placement or dignity deficiency, the astrologer examines other planets or calculates the **Lot of Fortune** or **Prenatal Syzygy** degree as potential Hyleg candidates.[2][5][7][26][29][35]


If no planet qualifies, the **Ascendant itself becomes the Hyleg** as a default measure.[2][8][26][35]

### B. Identifying the Alcocoden: The Giver of Years


Once the **Hyleg** is identified, the astrologer locates the **Alcocoden** (also called **Kadhkhudah**, **Houseruler**, **Governor**, or **Giver of Years**)—the planet that **rules the Hyleg's degree and has the strongest dignity in that degree's location.**[2][5][7][8][22][32][35]


**Critical Requirement:** The Alcocoden **must aspect the Hyleg** (conjunction, sextile, square, trine, or opposition). Without an aspect connecting them, no vitality relationship is established—the Hyleg would lack "form" in the material world.[8][35]


**Determination Method:**


1. Identify the **Hyleg** (planet or point with greatest dignity in the five hylegical points, placed in a hylegical house)
2. Look at the Hyleg's **degree position**
3. Determine which planet rules that degree's **term** (bound) or has the most essential dignity in that specific degree
4. Verify that this planet **aspects the Hyleg** by Ptolemaic aspect (conjunction, sextile, square, trine, opposition)
5. That planet becomes the **Alcocoden**


**Classical vs. Medieval Definitions:**


- **Hellenistic (Greek) Definition:** The **bound lord** (bound ruler) of the Hyleg's degree, functioning as a limiting principle that constrains the Hyleg's expression and determines lifespan ceiling
- **Medieval Definition:** The **almuten** (planet with most dignity) in the Hyleg's place, determining minimum lifespan; any planet with the most dignity can serve as Alcocoden


Ibn Ezra and later medieval astrologers adopted the **medieval definition**, which allows greater flexibility in identification.[2][32][35]


**Source:** [2][5][7][8][22][32][35][37]


### C. Planetary Years: The Deterministic Lifespan Base


Once the **Alcocoden** is identified, the astrologer assigns **planetary years** based on the Alcocoden's condition (essential and accidental dignity, house placement, aspects):


**Planetary Year Values (All Traditions):**


| **Planet** | **Great Years** | **Mean Years** | **Least Years** | **Principle** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Saturn** | 57 | 43 | 30 | Longest influence; structural limitation |
| **Jupiter** | 79 | 45 | 12 | Expansive and variable |
| **Mars** | 66 | 40 | 15 | Volatile and dynamic |
| **Sun** | 120 | 69 | 19 | Supreme vitality but concentrated |
| **Venus** | 82 (or 84) | 45 | 8 | Moderate influence; shortest "least years" |
| **Mercury** | 76 | 13 | 8 | Highly variable with condition |
| **Moon** | 108 | 19 | 9 | Sensitive and modifiable |


**Source:** [7][10][22][32] compile these year values from classical sources including Ptolemy, Vettius Valens, Firmicus Maternus, and the medieval Arabic tradition.


**Assigning Great, Mean, or Least Years:**


The **condition of the Alcocoden** determines which year-category applies:


| **Condition of Alcocoden** | **Years Assigned** | **Rationale** |
|---|---|---|
| **Angular house + High essential dignity** | **Great Years** | Planet at maximum power to sustain life |
| **Succedent house + Moderate dignity** | **Mean Years** | Planet at intermediate strength |
| **Cadent house + Poor dignity (detriment/fall)** | **Least Years** | Planet weakened; minimal sustained influence |


**Critical Distinction (Hellenistic vs. Medieval):**


- **Vettius Valens (2nd century):** Used **Great Years as MAXIMUM lifespan**, which could be cut short by malefic directions
- **Medieval astrologers (Bonatti, Ibn Ezra):** Treated Alcocoden years as **MINIMUM lifespan**, requiring malefic direction to cut shorter


This is a fundamental difference in how the calculation is applied.[7][32]


**Example Calculation (Charlie Chaplin, from Source [22]):**


- **Hyleg:** Moon at 26° Scorpio (angular, in rulership of Mars and term of Venus)
- **Alcocoden:** Mars (opposes Moon, has rulership and term dignity in Moon's place)
- **Mars's Condition:** Angular (in 1st house) but in **Detriment** (Taurus is Mars's detriment, opposite Scorpio rulership)


**Assessment:** Mars is Angular but poorly dignified → **Middle Years of Mars = 40.5 years**


This base lifespan of ~40 years is then **modified by witnessing planets** (see Section D below).


### D. Witnessing Planets: Benefic Advocates and Malefic Reducers


The **base lifespan indicated by the Alcocoden's years** is not absolute. Additional planets **aspect the Alcocoden**, and their condition determines whether they **add years (benefics)** or **subtract years (malefics)**:


**Benefic Aspects to Alcocoden (Add Years):**


- **Jupiter or Venus** in conjunction, sextile, or trine to Alcocoden
- Add the **Lesser Years of the benefic** (minimum contribution)
- Add the **Months** corresponding to the benefic's **Mean Years**


**Example:** If Venus (Lesser Years = 8) trines the Alcocoden, and Venus is in good condition, add **8 years + 45 months** (Venus's Mean Years) = approximately **11.75 years**


**Malefic Aspects to Alcocoden (Subtract Years):**


- **Mars or Saturn** in conjunction, square, or opposition to Alcocoden
- Subtract the **Lesser Years of the malefic**
- Subtract the **Months** corresponding to the malefic's **Mean Years**


**Condition Modifiers:**


- **Malefic in poor dignity (detriment/fall):** Subtract only **Days** instead of **Months** (reduced impact)
- **Malefic extremely weak (retrograde + poor dignity):** Subtract only **Weeks** instead of **Months** (minimal impact)


**Full Calculation Example (Charlie Chaplin, continued from Source [22]):**


Base from Alcocoden (Mars): **40.5 mean years**


**Venus in Taurus conjunct Mars** (Venus in good condition): 
- Add Venus's Lesser Years: +8 years
- Add Venus's Mean Years as months: +45 months = +3.75 years
- **Subtotal: 40.5 + 8 + 3.75 = 52.25 years**


**Jupiter in Capricorn (Fall) trines Mars** (Jupiter weakened but still benefic):
- Add Jupiter's Lesser Years: +12 years
- Add Jupiter's Mean Years as **days** (not months, due to fall): +45.5 days = ~1.5 months
- **Subtotal: 52.25 + 12 + 1.5 = 65.75 years**


**Moon in Scorpio (Fall) sextiles Jupiter** (Moon weak but contributes):
- Add Moon's Lesser Years: +25 years
- Add Moon's Mean Years as days: +66.5 days = ~2.2 months
- **Final Total: 65.75 + 25 + 2.2 = 93.15 years**


**No malefics aspect the Alcocoden, so no subtractions**


**Result: Charlie Chaplin is indicated to live ~93 years**


**Actual lifespan: Chaplin lived to 88 years** (slight variance, likely due to rounding or minor calculation adjustments).

### E. The Anareta: The Killing Planet and Malefic Direction


After establishing the **base lifespan from the Alcocoden**, classical astrology employs **primary directions** to determine **when death occurs** within that lifespan (or before it, if a powerful malefic cuts the life short).


The **Anareta** (Greek: "murderer" or "destroyer") is the **planet or point whose directed ray reaches the Hyleg and triggers death.**[2][5][7][55][58]


**Primary Direction Mechanics:**


1. **Direct the Hyleg's position forward** in zodiacal order according to **ascensional times** (or true primary directions in Ptolemy's method)
2. **Identify when the Hyleg arrives at** a degree occupied or ruled by **Saturn, Mars, or another malefic** (the Anareta)
3. The **number of degrees** the Hyleg travels **correlates to the number of years** until the malefic's aspect takes effect
4. If this occurs **within the Alcocoden's indicated lifespan**, death manifests at that time
5. If the Alcocoden's years are exhausted **before a malefic direction arrives**, the native dies from natural age rather than specific cause


**Critical Condition:** The malefic must be in a **malefic bound** (term ruled by Saturn, Mars, or another malefic). If the Anareta's degree falls in a **benefic bound** (Jupiter or Venus rule that term), the malefic is "softened" and may not kill.[7][35][41]

### The Complete Algorithm

(The Calculus of Vitality)
In the hierarchy of traditional judgment, no question is more primal than the computation of the length of life. The ancients viewed the nativity not as a promise of infinite potential, but as a bounded container of time. Before predicting empire, marriage, or wealth, the astrologer was obligated to determine if the native possessed the vital force (Hyleg) to survive infancy, and if so, the specific allotment of years (Alcocoden) granted by the celestial governors. This calculation represents the apex of technical astrology, requiring a synthesis of sect, dignity, and house position.
1A. The Hyleg Identification Algorithm
The Hyleg (from the Persian hīlāj, known in Greek as Hyleg or "Prerogator") is the planet or point that acts as the significator of life itself. It represents the body's capacity to withstand entropy. The identification of the Hyleg is algorithmic, strictly dependent on the Sect of the chart (Diurnal vs. Nocturnal) and the Aphetic Places (Life-Giving Houses).
Step 1: Definition of Aphetic Places
A planet cannot sustain life if it is hidden from the Ascendant or depressed in its location. Therefore, the Hyleg must be located in specific "Prorogative" zones. While minor variations exist between Ptolemy and later medieval authors, the consensus core of Aphetic places is:
* The 1st House (Ascendant): From 5 degrees above the horizon to 25 degrees below it (Ptolemy’s specific orb) or the entire whole sign/quadrant house (Medieval).
* The 10th House (Midheaven): The place of action and culmination.
* The 11th House (Good Spirit): The succedent house rising towards the Midheaven, considered the most fortunate place.
* The 7th House (Descendant) and 9th House (God): Secondary aphetic places.
* Excluded Places: The 8th, 12th, 6th, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th houses are generally ineligible. The 8th, 6th, and 12th are destructive (malefic); the 2nd and 3rd are cadent/succedent without aspectual strength; the 4th is the grave.
Step 2: The Priority Hierarchy
The search for the Hyleg follows a strict flow-chart logic.1
For a Diurnal Nativity (Day Birth):
1. The Sun: The Sun is the primary candidate. If the Sun is in an Aphetic place, it is the Hyleg.
2. The Moon: If the Sun is not in an Aphetic place (e.g., in the 12th house), check the Moon. If the Moon is in an Aphetic place, it becomes the Hyleg.
3. The Part of Fortune: If neither luminary is valid, some systems (Ptolemy) move to the planet having dignity over the Sun, Moon, and New Moon; others (Bonatti/Medieval) check the Part of Fortune (if Aphetic).
4. The Ascendant (Horoskopos): If all else fails, the degree of the Ascendant itself assumes the role of Hyleg.
5. The Syzygy: The degree of the prenatal New or Full Moon may also be considered in complex cases.
For a Nocturnal Nativity (Night Birth):
1. The Moon: The Moon is the primary candidate. If in an Aphetic place, it is the Hyleg.
2. The Sun: If the Moon is invalid, check the Sun (though the Sun is rarely Aphetic at night unless in the 7th/9th).
3. The Part of Fortune: If both luminaries fail, check the Part of Fortune.
4. The Ascendant: If no other point qualifies, the Ascendant is the Hyleg.
Step 3: The Condition of "Witnessing"
A crucial, often overlooked rule in the Arabic tradition (found in Bonatti and Al-Biruni) is that a candidate can only be Hyleg if it has a valid Alcocoden. If the Sun is in Aries, but Mars (its domicile ruler) makes no aspect to the Sun, the Sun cannot be Hyleg because it has no "guardian" to manage the years. The astrologer must then move to the next candidate in the hierarchy.4

1B. The Alcocoden Identification Algorithm
Once the Hyleg is established, the astrologer must identify the Alcocoden (from the Persian Alcocoden, meaning "Master of the House"). The Alcocoden is the planet that "owns" the Hyleg and distributes the years of life.
Step 1: Determine Potential Rulers
Calculate the essential dignities at the specific degree of the Hyleg. The potential Alcocoden must have dignity here. The standard scoring (Almuten) system is often used:
* Domicile Ruler: 5 points.
* Exaltation Ruler: 4 points.
* Triplicity Ruler: 3 points (select the primary ruler for the sect).
* Term (Bound) Ruler: 2 points.
* Face (Decan) Ruler: 1 point.
Step 2: The Aspect Requirement
To claim the role of Alcocoden, a ruler must regard (aspect) the Hyleg.
* Ptolemy's Rule: The Alcocoden must have dominion and aspect.
* Bonatti's Selection: If the Domicile ruler aspects the Hyleg, it is preferred. If the Domicile ruler is in aversion (no aspect), check the Exaltation ruler. If that fails, check the Triplicity or Term rulers. The planet with the highest dignity that also casts a ray to the Hyleg wins the role.1
Step 3: Calculation of the Years (The Quantitative Analysis)
The Alcocoden grants a base number of years derived from planetary periods, which is then modified by the planet’s condition (Angular, Succedent, Cadent) and the aspects it receives.
The Planetary Years Table:
The tradition assigns three values to each planet: Greater, Mean (Middle), and Lesser (Least).
Planet
	Lesser Years
	Mean Years
	Greater Years
	Saturn
	30
	43.5
	57
	Jupiter
	12
	45.5
	79
	Mars
	15
	40.5
	66
	Sun
	19
	69.5
	120
	Venus
	8
	45

The Algorithm for Granting Years:
1. Angular Alcocoden: If the Alcocoden is in the 1st, 10th, 7th, or 4th house and well-dignified (Domicile/Exaltation), it grants the Greater Years.
2. Succedent Alcocoden: If in the 11th, 5th, 2nd, or 8th (or Angular but with lesser dignity like Term/Triplicity), it grants the Mean Years.
3. Cadent Alcocoden: If in the 9th, 3rd, 6th, or 12th, or if Peregrine/Debilitated, it grants the Lesser Years. Note: A planet in Retrograde or Combustion may grant even less or deny life entirely.
Step 4: Mathematical Modifiers
The base years are rarely the final number. They must be adjusted by the "Witnesses"—other planets aspecting the Alcocoden.
* Benefics (Jupiter/Venus): If casting a helpful aspect (Trine/Sextile/Conjunction), add their Lesser Years to the sum. Some traditions add Lesser Years as years, others as months, depending on the strength of the benefic.
* Malefics (Saturn/Mars): If casting a harmful aspect (Square/Opposition), subtract their Lesser Years from the sum.
* South Node (Cauda Draconis): Often subtracts a quarter of the years if conjunct.
* Combustion: If the Alcocoden is combust, the years may be drastically reduced, often signifying a life cut short in childhood, unless the Sun is the Alcocoden.
1C. Worked Example: Forensic Application
Scenario: A Day Birth. Sun at 24° Libra (11th House). Ascendant Sagittarius.
1. Find Hyleg: Day chart. Sun is in the 11th House (Aphetic place). Sun is in Fall (Libra) but positionally strong. Sun is Hyleg.
2. Find Alcocoden:
   * Degree: 24° Libra.
   * Domicile: Venus.
   * Exaltation: Saturn.
   * Term: Mars (Egyptian terms usually start late in Libra, let's assume Mars terms for 24°).
   * Triplicity: Saturn (Day ruler of Air).
   * Candidate Check:
      * Assume Venus is in Sagittarius (1st House). She sextiles the Sun. She has Domicile authority. She qualifies.
      * Assume Saturn is in Capricorn (2nd House). He squares the Sun. He has Exaltation + Triplicity authority. He qualifies.
   * Selection: Venus has 5 points (Domicile). Saturn has 4 (Exaltation) + 3 (Triplicity) = 7 points. Saturn has more dignity and aspects the Sun. Saturn is Alcocoden.
3. Calculate Years:
   * Saturn is in Capricorn (Domicile). He is Succedent (2nd House).
   * Base: Mean Years (43.5 years). Note: Some might argue for Greater Years due to strong dignity, but Succedent placement usually caps at Mean.
   * Modifiers:
      * Venus (Benefic) is in the 1st, casting a sextile to Saturn. Add Venus Lesser Years (8). Calculation: 43.5 + 8 = 51.5.
      * Mars is in Cancer (8th), opposing Saturn. Subtract Mars Lesser Years (15).
      * Final Calculation: 51.5 - 15 = 36.5 Years.
   * Prediction: The native faces a critical vitality crisis (death or severe illness) at age 36 and 6 months.
