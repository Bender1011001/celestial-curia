The Theological Friction: Fate vs. Free Will   
Astrology has perpetually existed in tension with religious orthodoxy. 

● Christianity: The Church condemned the idea that stars compelled action, as this  negated the Free Will necessary for sin and salvation. The Thomistic compromise (St.  Thomas Aquinas) was: "The stars incline, but do not compel." They influence the body and passions, but the intellect and will remain free. 4 

● Hinduism (Sanatana Dharma): Vedic astrology faces no such conflict because of  Karma . The planets are not external tyrants but administrators of the soul's own past  actions. The chart is a diagnostic tool for Prarabdha Karma (ripening karma). Remedial  measures (Upaye)—gemstones, mantras, charity —are prescribed to mitigate negative  planetary periods, implying that destiny is malleable through spiritual effort. 11

It was only with the Enlightenment and the heliocentric revolution that astrology was  relegated to "occultism".2
