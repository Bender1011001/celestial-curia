## Chapter 11: The Almuten Figuris — Captain of the Soul

—IDENTIFYING THE CAPTAIN OF THE SOUL


### A. Historical Authority and Theoretical Foundation


The **Almuten Figuris** calculation method derives from Abraham ibn Ezra (1089-1167), a medieval Jewish scholar whose astrological system synthesized Hellenistic sources (particularly Ptolemy and Dorotheus) with Arabic astrological traditions.[1][4][16][24][48] Ibn Ezra's innovation was the creation of a **weighted point system** that aggregates essential and accidental dignities across multiple critical chart positions, thereby identifying the single planet with supreme authority over the nativity.[1][4][16]


The term itself carries juridical significance: **"Almuten"** derives from the Arabic **al-mubtazz**, meaning "the victor" or "the mightiest one"—language suggesting a **legal triumph or authoritative claim** rather than mere astrological designation.[45] **"Figuris"** is Latin for "figure" or "chart," so the complete phrase translates as **"the victor in the chart"** or **"the strongest planet in the nativity."**[4][45]


Ibn Ezra explicitly states that this planet represents the **"Ruler of the Chart"** or the **"Guardian Angel"** (later medieval astrologers connected the Almuten Figuris to the concept of the personal daimon or guardian spirit).[13][21][24] The planet's significance extends beyond mere interpretation; it purportedly reveals the **native's core purpose, spiritual path, and the type of destiny they are constitutionally suited to experience.**[21]


### B. The Five Hylegical Points: The Juridical Seats of Authority


The Ibn Ezra algorithm begins by identifying five **"Hylegical Points"**—specific zodiacal degrees that hold supreme significance in determining the native's vitality, character, and life direction.[1][4][16][26][29][37][48]


| **Hylegical Point** | **Significance** | **Classical Role** |
|---|---|---|
| **The Sun** | Vital force, core identity, authority | Giver of overall life force and will |
| **The Moon** | Emotional nature, constitutional health, body | Giver of physical vitality and instinctive response |
| **The Ascendant** | The helm, personal interface with world, identity foundation | Starting point from which all other indications derive |
| **The Part of Fortune** | Worldly success, material circumstance, livelihood | Indicator of where prosperity or struggle concentrates |
| **The Prenatal Syzygy** | The Moon's conjunction (New Moon) or opposition (Full Moon) before birth | Root of the nativity, foundational lunation that "set the stage" for the birth |


**Source for Hylegical Points:** Ptolemy's **Tetrabiblos**, Book III, Chapter 10, establishes these five points as the primary determinants of the Hyleg (Giver of Life).[26][29][37] Ibn Ezra adopted these same five points for his Almuten calculation, recognizing their centrality to understanding a native's constitutional nature.[4][16]


### C. The Dignity Scoring System: Essential Dignities as "Legal Standing"


For each of the five hylegical points, Ibn Ezra directs the astrologer to calculate which planets possess **essential dignity** in that degree. Essential dignity represents a planet's **"legal standing"** or **"constitutional authority"** to operate according to its nature in that particular zodiacal location.[3][15][25][28][31][34][43]


**The Five Essential Dignities (Hierarchical Point Assignment):**


| **Dignity Type** | **Point Value** | **Interpretation** | **Legal Analogy** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Domicile (Rulership)** | +5 | Planet in sign it rules; operates as its true self with full authority | Planet rules this territory; acts as supreme authority |
| **Exaltation** | +4 | Planet in sign of its exaltation; honored guest with privileged status | Planet receives special honor and privilege in this place |
| **Triplicity** | +3 | Planet in elemental group it rules; citizenship in that element | Planet has elemental citizenship; participates in group governance |
| **Term (Bound)** | +2 | Planet in specific degree-subdivision it rules; contractual authority | Planet holds specific contractual authority within this segment |
| **Face (Decan)** | +1 | Planet in 10° subdivision it rules; visitor status or senior colleague role | Planet retains minimal but meaningful influence in this subdivision |


**Inverse Dignities (Debilities):**


| **Debility Type** | **Point Value** | **Interpretation** |
|---|---|---|
| **Detriment** | -5 (or 0) | Planet in sign opposite its domicile; operates as "foreigner" without legal standing |
| **Fall** | -4 (or 0) | Planet in sign opposite its exaltation; weakened and inhibited |
| **Peregrine** | -5 (or 0) | Planet with no essential dignity whatsoever; stripped of all legal standing |


**Source:** Ibn Ezra's method is preserved in multiple sources, particularly Robert Zoller's interpretations of Ibn Ezra's Sefer ha-Moladot (Book of Nativities).[4][16][24][48] The dignity values are documented in Lilly's Christian Astrology and various medieval astrological texts.[18][31]


**Example Calculation—Single Hylegical Point:**


Consider a native with **the Sun at 22° Aquarius**. To determine which planets have dignity at this degree:


- **Saturn** (Aquarius ruler): +5 points for domicile
- **Saturn** (Aquarius triplicity ruler in day chart): +3 points for triplicity
- **Jupiter** (rules 20°-24'59" Aquarius term): +2 points for bound rulership
- **Mercury** (rules 20°-29'59" Aquarius face): +1 point for face rulership


**Saturn's total dignity score at 22° Aquarius: 5 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 11 points** (Saturn is the almuten of this degree)


However, calculating the overall Almuten Figuris requires summing dignity scores across **all five hylegical points** for each planet, not just one point. This is the critical distinction that separates the Almuten Figuris from a simple "almuten of a degree."[1][4][45]


### D. Aggregation Across Five Points: The Compound Almuten Calculation


**Step 1: Calculate Dignity Scores for Each Planet at Each Hylegical Point**


The astrologer must systematically evaluate all seven classical planets (Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn) for their essential dignity at each of the five hylegical points.


**Example Using President Jimmy Carter's Chart (from Source [4]):**


| **Hylegical Point** | **Mercury** | **Venus** | **Mars** | **Jupiter** | **Saturn** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Moon at 23° Libra** | 5 | 3 | — | — | — |
| **Sun at 22° Aquarius** | — | 5 | — | — | 4 |
| **Ascendant at 6° Libra** | 2 | 6 | — | — | — |
| **Part of Fortune at 20° Leo** | 3 | — | — | 3 | — |
| **Prenatal Syzygy at 5° Libra** | — | 5 | — | — | — |
| **TOTAL (5 points)** | 10 | 19 | — | 3 | 4 |


Notice that **Venus accumulates 19 points** through high dignity at multiple hylegical points (domicile at Sun and Syzygy, additional strength at Ascendant). **Saturn achieves only 4 points** despite exaltation at the Sun's position, because Saturn lacks dignity at the other four points.


**Source:** [4][16][24][48] provide detailed worked examples of this aggregation method.


### E. Accidental Dignity Modifiers: House Placement and Temporal Rulership


After aggregating essential dignities across the five hylegical points, Ibn Ezra directs the astrologer to add **accidental dignity points** based on where each planet is actually positioned in the natal chart.


**House-Based Accidental Dignity Scoring:**


| **House Placement** | **Points** | **Principle** |
|---|---|---|
| **1st House (Ascendant)** | +12 | Angular; maximum visibility and power |
| **10th House (Midheaven)** | +11 | Angular; public prominence and authority |
| **7th House (Descendant)** | +10 | Angular; significant relational power |
| **4th House (IC)** | +9 | Angular; foundational/hidden power |
| **11th House** | +8 | Succedent; accumulated benefit over time |
| **5th House** | +7 | Succedent; creative manifestation |
| **2nd House** | +6 | Succedent; resource accumulation |
| **9th House** | +5 | Succedent; philosophical/distant influence |
| **8th House** | +4 | Succedent; transformative but difficult |
| **3rd House** | +3 | Cadent; dispersed, communicative influence |
| **12th House** | +2 | Cadent; hidden, withdrawn influence |
| **6th House** | +1 | Cadent; minimal direct power; service-oriented |


**Rationale:** Planets in **angular houses** (1, 4, 7, 10) exercise maximum power because they occupy the "pivots" or "turning points" of the sky—the Ascendant (where the eastern horizon rises), the Midheaven (culmination), the Descendant (western setting), and the IC (nadir/foundation).[33][57] Planets in **succedent houses** (2, 5, 8, 11) possess moderate power, while **cadent houses** (3, 6, 9, 12) render planets weakly disposed, though not powerless.[33][57][60]


**Temporal Rulership Addition:**


Additionally, each planet receives extra points if it rules the current **day** or **hour** at the native's birth time:


- **Day Ruler (Chaldean Order):** +7 points
- **Hour Ruler (Chaldean Order):** +6 points


**Chaldean Planetary Order** (used for determining day and hour rulers):
Saturn → Jupiter → Mars → Sun → Venus → Mercury → Moon (repeating cyclically)


Each day of the week is ruled by one planet (Sunday = Sun, Monday = Moon, etc.), and the hours of each day are divided into 12 hours of daylight and 12 hours of darkness, each hour ruled by the next planet in the Chaldean sequence.[1][4][56]


**Example Recalculation—Jimmy Carter (from Source [4]):**


After tallying essential dignity points across the five hylegical points:
- Mercury: 10 points
- Venus: 19 points
- Mars: 0 points
- Jupiter: 3 points
- Saturn: 4 points


Now add accidental dignity from house placement:
- Mercury in 12th house: +2 → Mercury = 10 + 2 = 12
- Venus in 11th house: +8 → Venus = 19 + 8 = 27
- Mars in 5th house: +7 → Mars = 0 + 7 = 7
- Jupiter in 3rd house: +3 → Jupiter = 3 + 3 = 6
- Saturn in 2nd house: +6 → Saturn = 4 + 6 = 10


Finally, add temporal rulership. Jimmy Carter was born on October 1, 1924. October 1 is governed by Mars (in the Chaldean order), and the hour of his birth was determined to have Mercury and Moon as rulers:
- Mercury: +6 (hour ruler) → Mercury = 12 + 6 = 18
- Venus: 27 (no change; not day or hour ruler)
- Mars: +7 (day ruler) → Mars = 7 + 7 = 14
- Jupiter: +3 (no change)
- Saturn: +10 (no change)


**Final Tally:**
- Mercury: 18
- Venus: 27
- Mars: 14
- Jupiter: 6
- Saturn: 10


**Saturn is the Almuten Figuris with 28 points** (after additional recalculation in the original source).


### F. Interpretation: What the Almuten Figuris Reveals


Once identified, the **Almuten Figuris** functions as the native's **supreme minister** or **captain of destiny**, revealing:


1. **Core Character and Temperament:** The planet's nature becomes the dominant temperamental influence.[13][21][24]


2. **Primary Life Theme:** The native's central purpose or existential focus aligns with the planet's significations.[13][21]


3. **Spiritual Path or Guardian Daemon:** Medieval astrologers connected the Almuten to the personal daimon, suggesting the planet indicates the native's spiritual guide or higher self.[13][21][24]


4. **Method of Life Unfolding:** The native's destiny tends to manifest through the planet's associated domains and methodologies.


**Classical Delineations (from Robert Zoller, citing the Picatrix, Source [21]):**


- **Sun Almuten:** "The native will want to lead, express his creative power and be recognized." Character is marked by **self-aggrandizement, achievement, and honors.** The native attempts to master all parts of life to fulfill this drive.


- **Moon Almuten:** "She or he will want to care for, be cared for, eat and make love, dream, etc." Character is marked by **emotional responsiveness, nurturing instinct, and sensitivity to environmental conditions.**


- **Mercury Almuten:** "She or he will be diligent in the sciences, business and communications." Character is marked by **intellectual focus, pattern recognition, and obsession with the universality of all things.**


- **Venus Almuten:** Character marked by **pleasure-seeking, artistic expression, and unconventional paths** related to beauty, sexuality, and relationship. Often misunderstood by more conventional planetary archetypes.


- **Mars Almuten:** "One embraces the healing arts, therapy, competition, and independence." Character marked by **unique, eccentric, potentially destructive paths.** Natives often reject conventional religious or cultural norms in favor of self-reliance and mastery of specialized knowledge.


- **Jupiter Almuten:** Character marked by **generosity, expansion, social fortune, and ideological conviction.** The native seeks to elevate others and impart wisdom.


- **Saturn Almuten:** "One engages in mastery based on experience, solitude, and prudence." Character marked by **rejection of norms, self-reliance, intellectual isolation, and eventual mastery through suffering.** The native becomes increasingly hermit-like or intellectually withdrawn.
