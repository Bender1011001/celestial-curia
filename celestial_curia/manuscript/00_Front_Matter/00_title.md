## Foreword

The documents assembled herein represent a comprehensive synthesis of pre-1700 astrological tradition. This work is not a modern interpretation but a forensic reconstruction of the technical and philosophical apparatus used by practitioners from Vettius Valens (2nd century CE) through Guido Bonatti (13th century CE) and William Lilly (17th century CE).

The goal is philological accuracy: to present the tradition as it understood itself, not as we wish it had been. Modern psychological astrology, with its emphasis on archetypes, potentials, and personal growth, represents a fundamentally different metaphysics. This codex returns to the deterministic, hierarchical, and computational worldview that defined astrology for over two millennia.

**What You Will Find:**

- **Part I: Foundations** — The philosophical framework, the Thema Mundi as archetypal template, and the Doctrine of Sect as the primary organizational principle.

- **Part II: Celestial State** — The complete system of Essential and Accidental Dignities, planetary delineations by sign, and the influence of Fixed Stars and Lunar Nodes.

- **Part III: Terrestrial State** — The Twelve Houses (Places), the Ptolemaic Aspects, and the Hermetic Lots (Arabic Parts).

- **Part IV: Algorithms** — The Almuten Figuris calculation (Ibn Ezra) and the Calculus of Vitality (Hyleg/Alcocoden).

- **Part V: Chronocrators** — The nested hierarchy of Time-Lords: Zodiacal Releasing, Firdaria, and Annual Profections.

- **Part VI: Applied Astrology** — Medical Astrology (Decumbiture) and Mundane Astrology (Eclipses and Universal Causation).
