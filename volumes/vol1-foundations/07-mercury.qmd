# Mercury: The Scribe

8. Mercury: The Common Star through the Zodiac
Mercury (Hermes) is the "common" star (communis), taking the nature of the planets it joins. Its delineations focus on intellect, commerce, and speech.
8.1 Mercury in the Signs of Dignity
Mercury in Virgo (Exaltation & Domicile)
* Firmicus Maternus: Mercury is exalted at 15° Virgo and also rules the sign.8 This is the "scribe," the "scholar," the "administrator." High intelligence and analytical ability.
* Paulus Alexandrinus: Mercury rules the third decan of Virgo.
* Al-Biruni: "Accountants," "mathematicians," "granary keepers."
Mercury in Gemini (Domicile)
* Firmicus Maternus: Mercury's diurnal house. "Orators," "philosophers," "messengers." Quick wit and versatility.
* Al-Biruni: Gemini is "Loud-Voiced." Mercury here signifies "public speaking," "announcements," "news."
8.2 Mercury in the Signs of Debility
Mercury in Pisces (Fall/Detriment)
* Firmicus Maternus: Mercury is depressed. "Confused speech," "poor memory," "deception." The watery nature of Pisces dissolves the distinctions Mercury tries to make.
* Al-Biruni: "Fishermen," "sailors," "wandering poets."
Mercury in Sagittarius (Detriment)
* Firmicus Maternus: Opposite Gemini. "Blasphemy," "errors in judgment," "tactlessness." Mercury is too "broad" here, missing the details.
