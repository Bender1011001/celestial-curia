# Conditions of Empowerment and Maltreatment: Solar Proximity and Bonatti's Considerations

## PART II: FORENSIC CONDITIONS OF SOLAR PROXIMITY—CAZIMI, COMBUSTION, AND OPERATIONAL CAPACITY


### A. Cazimi: Empowerment Through Proximity (0°0' to 0°17')


**Definition and Classical Understanding**


**Cazimi** derives from the Arabic term **"kaṣmīmī,"** meaning **"in the heart"** or **"in the center."**[7][8][10] A planet is cazimi when it occupies a conjunction with the Sun within **0 degrees and 17 minutes of arc** (0°17')—an extraordinarily tight orb.[7][8][10]


The classical understanding of cazimi represents a paradox that modern astrology has largely abandoned: **at the closest possible proximity to the Sun, a planet is not debilitated but rather empowered in a specific and profound way.**[7][8][10][11][25]


As one classical source articulates: "When in the very core of the Sun at 0° 17' or less, a planet is cazimi and is briefly strengthened by its contact and union with the solar principle, being reborn and re-forged in its own depth of being."[11][25] The metaphor is alchemical—the planet is not burned away but **transmuted**, refined into its essential nature through contact with solar consciousness.[7][8][10][11][25]


**The Mechanism of Empowerment**


The empowerment operates through a specific principle: **The Sun represents the conscious will, the observer's eye, the ability to illuminate and clarify.** When a planet enters cazimi, it achieves perfect alignment with solar consciousness—there is no separation between the planet's archetypal principle and the solar light itself.[7][8][10][11][25]


The result is described as **"bestowal of brilliance or genius"**—a concentration of the planet's essential power so intense that it becomes capable of extraordinary manifestation.[7][8][10][11] Examples abound in historical figures: **Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart had Mercury cazimi**, a condition that rendered his Mercury brilliance virtually genius-level, despite also being combusted (a seemingly contradictory condition that classical astrology resolves through the understanding that combustion affects the planet's "outer material crust" while cazimi refines its "essential nature").[8][10][25]


**Why Cazimi Transcends Combustion**


The classical texts are explicit that cazimi represents a **threshold condition** qualitatively different from ordinary combustion. Within 17 minutes of exact conjunction, the Sun ceases burning away the planet's manifestation and instead becomes a **catalyst for essence expression**.[7][8][10][11][25]


As one source explains: "What is being made combust is the detritus and silt of the planet, the outer material crust which interacts with the physical material world in which power and strength are measured very tangibly and crudely. The power of these planets is not destroyed it is simply being transferred to more spiritual and intangible realms which are sourced within."[11][25]


**Cazimi thus operates as the inverse of combustion: rather than debilitating a planet's worldly manifestation, it refines and concentrates the planet's archetypal essence—a transformation that becomes visible as genius, brilliance, or extraordinary capacity in its domain.**[7][8][10][11][25]


### B. Combustion: Debilitation Through Proximity (0°18' to 8°00')


**Definition and Classical Understanding**


**Combustion** describes the condition wherein a planet falls within the Sun's "fiery rays" but is **not** in cazimi—that is, from just beyond 17 minutes to approximately 8 degrees of separation from the Sun.[7][8][11][25]


Unlike cazimi, combustion represents genuine **debilitation of operational capacity**.[7][8][11][25] The planet becomes obscured by solar brightness; its significations become burned away or distorted; its natural functions are compromised.[7][8][11][25]


**The Critical Distinction: Degree Matters**


Within the combustion range, **distance matters significantly**:[7][8][11][25]


- Planets within **0°18' to 3°** suffer the most severe combustion
- Planets within **3° to 8°** experience moderate combustion
- The **exact orb of separation** determines intensity—closer degrees mean more severe debilitation


Combustion's effects are **not universal but depend on planetary nature** and on what the planet rules in the native's chart. When Mars is combust, the native experiences difficulties in courage, ambition, and initiative—exactly the domains where Mars should be strong.[8][11][25] When Venus is combust, relational harmony becomes obscured despite Venus's beneficent nature.[8][11] When Mercury is combust, clarity of thought and communication becomes confused despite Mercury's natural facility with words.[8][28]


**The Particular Torment of Mercury Combustion**


Classical sources note that **Mercury is especially prone to combustion** because Mercury never travels more than 28° from the Sun—making combustion far more common for Mercury than for outer planets.[8][11] Yet combustion is also particularly damaging for Mercury because Mercury's essential function is **clarity and transmission of intelligence**. When combusted, Mercury cannot transmit clarity; instead, it becomes confused, contradictory, and self-defeating.[8][11][28]


One source notes: "Mercury is the planet of communication, of intelligence. He is responsible for people's analytical ability, rational thinking and flexibility. Therefore, in a state of combustion, there is a difficulty in obtaining clarity in situations, causing a certain mental confusion and in the reasoning processes in general."[8] This creates a paradox where the native possesses Mercurial intelligence but cannot access it cleanly—every thought becomes entangled with solar ego or confusion.[8][11][28]


### C. "Under the Sunbeams": The Intermediate Debilitation (8°01' to 17°00')


**Definition and Operational Principle**


Between 8 degrees and 17 minutes of separation from the Sun lies a condition called **"Under the Sunbeams"**—a category intermediate between combustion and freedom from solar influence.[7][11][25] Planets in this condition are **mildly debilitated** but not so severely as combusted planets.[7][11][25]


The effect is one of **faintness and lack of visibility** rather than burning away. As classical sources describe it, planets under the sunbeams are "slightly warmed and vitalized" but remain "on the sidelines" without their conventional strength or status.[11][25]


The weakening increases as the planet approaches the Sun—a planet at 8°05' suffers less under-the-sunbeams debilitation than a planet at 8°30'.[7][11] The progression toward combustion zone is gradual, not abrupt.[7][11][25]


**The Practical Implication: Opacity Rather Than Burning**


Under the sunbeams, planets do not cease to function—they simply function with **reduced visibility and impact**. A Venus under the sunbeams still indicates relational capacity, but the native's relational charms go unnoticed or un-appreciated. A Jupiter under the sunbeams still indicates luck, but the luck manifests subtly, without fanfare. A Mars under the sunbeams still indicates courage, but the courage operates quietly, without recognition.[7][11][25]


The distinction from combustion is crucial: **Combustion burns away actual capacity; being under the sunbeams veils capacity without destroying it.**[7][11][25]


### D. Operational Capacity: The Three-Tiered Model


The conditions of solar proximity create a **three-tiered hierarchy of operational capacity**:[7][8][11][25]


| Condition | Orb | Operational Capacity | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Cazimi** | 0°00'-0°17' | **Amplified** | Essence refined; brilliance or genius emerges |
| **Under the Sunbeams** | 0°18'-8°00' | **Moderate Debilitation** | Fainter manifestation; impact veiled but not destroyed |
| **Combustion** | 8°01'-17°00' | **Severe Debilitation** | Manifestation obscured/burned; significations compromised |
| **Free from Sun** | 17°01'+ | **Normal** | Full operational capacity |


This hierarchy establishes that **proximity to the Sun is not uniformly debilitating but follows a graded scale** where extreme proximity (cazimi) paradoxically becomes empowering, moderate proximity becomes subtly inhibiting, and greater distance allows normal function.[7][8][11][25]

## PART III: BONATTI'S 146 CONSIDERATIONS—DISQUALIFYING CONDITIONS AS FORENSIC RULES


### A. The Theoretical Foundation: Radicality and Competence


Guido Bonatti's **146 Considerations**, preserved in the *Liber Astronomiae* and translated into English by William Lilly in the 17th century, constitute the most exhaustive compendium of classical astrological conditions determining whether a matter can "come to pass."[13][16][19][22][31][35][45][48][56][59]


Bonatti explicitly established that before interpreting a chart, the astrologer must determine whether the chart is **"radical"**—that is, whether it is suitable for judgment and whether the planets involved are actually competent to manifest their significations.[16][22][31][35][45][48][54][56][59]


As Bonatti himself states in his foundational principle: "All of the Ancients that have wrote of Questions, doe give warning to the Astrologer, that before he deliver judgment he will consider whether the Figure is radicall and capable of judgment."[22][31][54] Radicality is not a guarantee of favorable outcomes—it is the **minimum condition establishing that judgment is even possible**.[16][22][31][35][45][48][54][56][59]


### B. Besiegement: The Trap Between Malefics


**Definition and Operational Meaning**


**Besiegement** (also called "enclosure") describes a condition wherein a planet **separates from one malefic and applies to another malefic** without receiving assistance from either.[14][17][35] The besieged planet is, metaphorically, **"between a rock and a hard place"**—facing inescapable opposition from two directions.[14][17][35]


Bonatti is explicit: "A planet is besieged when it separates from one of the malefics and applies to the other. In besiegement only the conjunction, square and opposition are considered. Just like a besieged city, the planet in this condition is in serious trouble which will be difficult to escape."[14][17]


**The Critical Condition: Lack of Reception**


The debilitating effect of besiegement depends absolutely on **whether the besieged planet receives protection through reception** (being in a sign ruled by one of the malefics).[14][17][35] Without reception, besiegement is essentially **unmitigated**—the planet has no refuge, no support, no escape.[14][17][35]


As classical sources articulate: "All that is related to, and signified by, the besieged planet will encounter difficulty and impediment."[14][17] If the besieged planet is the Moon (significator of the body and health), the native faces health crises. If the besieged planet rules the 1st house (the native's self), the native's identity is under siege. If the besieged planet is the significator of the matter asked about, the matter itself becomes impossible to accomplish.[14][17][35]


**Historical Case Study: Marie Antoinette**


In Marie Antoinette's nativity, the **Moon is besieged**—separating from a square with Mars and applying to a square with Saturn, all without reception to mitigate the pressure.[14] The Moon, in this configuration, signifies the Queen's person and her capacity for emotional stability and prudent judgment. The besiegement between Mars (aggression, revolutionary fervor) and Saturn (restriction, authority challenged) resulted in exactly what Bonatti's rule predicts: the native's **identity and person under siege, ultimately destroyed by the gap between oppressive authority and revolutionary violence** she could not escape.[14]


### C. The Void of Course Moon: The Disconnection That Prevents Completion


**Classical Definition: The Hellenistic Understanding**


The **Void of Course Moon** represents one of the most misunderstood conditions in modern astrology, with contemporary interpretation diverging sharply from classical (Hellenistic) understanding.[15][39][42] 


In the **Hellenistic definition** (from the Greek *kenodromia*, "running in the void" or "running in the emptiness"), the Moon is void of course when it **will not complete any Ptolemaic aspect within the following 30 degrees of its journey, regardless of sign boundary.**[15][39][42] This creates a condition of profound **isolation and lack of connection** to the broader astrological pattern.[15][39][42]


The Hellenistic void is distinct from the modern definition, which focuses on sign boundaries. The Hellenistic definition is far more rare—occurring roughly once every three days—yet far more potent when it occurs.[15][39][42]


**The Principle: Disconnection Prevents Manifestation**


Bonatti articulates the principle directly: The Moon is "the School-mistress of all things" and "the Bringer-down of all the Planet's influences" and functions as a kind of "internuncio" (intermediary) between planets, "carrying their virtues from one to the other."[19][45][48][56][59]


When the Moon is void of course, **this intermediary function ceases**. The planets cannot communicate their intentions to one another; their influences cannot be transmitted to the native; matters being asked about cannot progress because the Moon—the primary agent of manifestation in the terrestrial realm—is isolated and impotent.[15][19][39][42][45][48][56][59]


**Why Modern Practice Differs**


Contemporary horary astrology adopted the practice of avoiding void of course Moons entirely, treating the condition as an automatic disqualification. However, Bonatti himself was less absolute. He notes that "All manner of matters goe hardly on (except the principall significators be very strong) when the Moon is voyd of course; yet somewhat she performes if voyd of course, and be either in Taurus, Cancer, Sagittarius or Pisces."[22][51]


Bonatti's subtlety reveals the classical view: **Void of course is a serious impediment, but not necessarily an absolute disqualification.** If the principal significators (the planets ruling the matter being asked) are very well placed and dignified, the matter can still come to pass—but it will encounter significant obstacles, delays, and complications.[15][22][39][42][51]


### D. Additional Critical Considerations: The Red Flag System


Beyond besiegement and void of course, Bonatti identified numerous other conditions that disqualify judgment or render matters unlikely to come to pass:[13][16][19][22][31][35][45][48][54][56][59]


**Saturn in the 1st or 7th House (the Astrologer's Impairment):**


When Saturn occupies the 1st house (astrologer's self-representation in horary) or 7th house (the astrologer specifically in horary practice), the astrologer's **judgment becomes corrupted or unreliable.**[22][31][45][48][54] The astrologer either lacks competence to judge properly, harbors unconscious bias, or is personally compromised in understanding the matter.[22][31][45][48][54] As Bonatti notes: "If Saturn be in the Ascendant, especially Retrograde, the matter of that Question seldome or never comes good" and "Saturn in the seventh either corrupts the judgment of the Astrologer, or is a Signe the matter propounded will come from one misfortune to another."[22][31][45][48][51][54]


**The Lord of the Ascendant (or Significator) in its Detriment or Fall without Reception:**


When the planet ruling the matter (the significator) or the planet ruling the ascendant (the querent) is positioned in its detriment (opposite sign to its domicile) or fall (opposite sign to its exaltation) **without reception** (without being in a sign ruled by a benefic), the planet cannot properly execute its function.[16][22][31][35][45][48][54][59] Bonatti states: "And if it be an Infortune, though they do not give him virtue, yet without a reception it will not do; but with a reception, if he be not afflicted, it signifies a good end of the matter, though not without much labour and tediousness."[45][48][56]


**The Moon in the Via Combusta (15° Libra to 15° Scorpio):**


The **Via Combusta** ("the burning way") represents an area of the zodiac where both luminaries are debilitated—the Sun in its fall (Libra) and the Moon in its fall (Scorpio).[37][40][51] When the Moon occupies this region, it suffers dual debilitation and cannot properly transmit influence to bring matters to fruition.[37][40][51] Bonatti notes: "It's not safe to judge when the Moon is in the later degrees of a Signe, especially in Gemini, Scorpio or Capricorn; or as some say she is in Via Combusta, which is, when she is in the last 15 degrees of Libra, or the first fifteen degrees of Scorpio."[22][51]


**Early or Late Ascendant Degrees (3° or less, or 27°+):**


An ascendant in the first 3 degrees of a sign suggests the **question is premature**—the matter is not yet ripe for judgment because conditions haven't properly formed.[22][31][45][48][54] An ascendant in the last 3 degrees (27°-30°) suggests the **question is too late**—the matter is essentially concluded and judgment cannot change what has already happened.[22][31][45][48][54] Bonatti: "If 27, 28 or 29 degrees ascend of any Signe, it's no wayes safe to give judgment, except the Querent be of years corresponding to the number of degrees ascending."[22][51]


### E. The Integration Model: How Bonatti's Considerations Work Together


**The Sequential Analysis Protocol**


Classical astrologers employing Bonatti's system would **check conditions in a specific sequence**, progressively ruling out matters unfit for judgment:[16][22][31][35][45][48][54][56][59]


**First Filter: Radicality Checks**


1. Is the hour lord the same as the Ascendant ruler, or are they in the same triplicity? (If not, the question lacks synchronization and may not be "radical")
2. Is Saturn in the 1st or 7th? (If yes, the astrologer's judgment is suspect)
3. Are the testimonies of fortunes and infortunes equal? (If yes, the outcome cannot be determined)


**Second Filter: Impediment Checks**


4. Is the significator in detriment or fall without reception? (If yes, it cannot properly execute)
5. Is the Ascendant in early (0-3°) or late (27-30°) degrees? (If yes, the timing is wrong)
6. Is the Moon void of course AND are the principal significators weak? (If yes, manifestation is prevented)


**Third Filter: Specific Debilitations**


7. Is the significator besieged between malefics without reception? (If yes, it is inescapably trapped)
8. Is the Moon in the Via Combusta? (If yes, transmission is blocked)
9. Is the significator retrograde and afflicted simultaneously? (If yes, it cannot manifest)


**Only if the chart passes all three filter levels can the astrologer proceed to judgment with reasonable confidence that the planets involved are actually competent to manifest their significations.**[16][22][31][35][45][48][54][56][59]

## SYNTHESIS: THE INTEGRATED COMPETENCY FRAMEWORK


### The Three Systems as Unified Architecture


The brilliance of the classical framework is that **Sect, Solar Proximity, and Bonatti's Considerations operate as three nested layers of a single jurisprudential system**:[1][2][7][8][16][22][31][35][43][45][46][48][49][50][54][56]


**Layer 1—Sect: Constitutional Fitness**


Does the planet belong to the faction in power (in sect)? If yes, the planet possesses constitutional authority to manifest its nature. If no, the planet's manifestation is constrained or perverted. Sect establishes whether the planet has **the right to act** at all.[1][2][43][46][49][50]


**Layer 2—Solar Proximity: Operational Capacity**


Even if constitutionally fit (in sect), can the planet actually operationalize its function? Cazimi represents enhanced capacity; under the sunbeams represents diminished capacity; combustion represents severe impairment; freedom from sunbeams represents normal capacity. Solar proximity establishes whether the planet has **the means to act**.[7][8][11][25]


**Layer 3—Bonatti's Considerations: Disqualifying Impediments**


Even if constitutionally fit and operationally capable, does the chart contain disqualifying impediments that prevent any manifestation? Besiegement traps the planet; void of course Moon disconnects transmission; detriment without reception removes support; certain placements prevent the astrologer from achieving reliable judgment. These conditions establish whether the planet is **permitted to act** under the current conditions.[16][22][31][35][45][48][54][56][59]


### The Competency Verdict


**A planet is deemed "competent to act" only when all three conditions align:**


- The planet **belongs to the empowered sect** (or is in a neutral or beneficial sect position)
- The planet **possesses operational capacity** (not combusted, not severely under the sunbeams, ideally benefiting from cazimi if highly conjunct the Sun)
- The chart **lacks disqualifying impediments** that would prevent manifestation (not besieged, significator not in unreceptioned detriment/fall, Moon not void of course while significators are weak, etc.)


**When these three conditions fail, the planet is not "competent to act"—and no favorable aspect or dignified placement can overcome this fundamental incapacity.**[1][2][7][8][16][22][31][35][43][45][46][48][49][50][54][56][59]
