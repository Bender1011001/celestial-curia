## Chapter 19b: Zodiacal Releasing (Aphesis) Activation Logic

Zodiacal Releasing (from Valens) partitions time using the Lot of Spirit (Career/Destiny) or Lot of Fortune (Body/Health).

**Level hierarchy:**
1.  **Level 1 (General):** Periods of years (Planetary Minor Years).
2.  **Level 2 (Sub-periods):** Months (Planetary Minor Years / 12).
3.  **Level 3 (Sub-sub):** Days.

**Activation Logic (The Peak Periods):**
*   **Angles from the Lot:** The signs angular (1st, 4th, 7th, 10th) to the Lot being released are the most active/consequential "Peak Periods."
    *   **Foregrounds (1st/10th):** Intense activity, visibility, high stakes.
    *   **Opposite (7th):** Challenges, culminates, public interaction.
    *   **Subterraneous (4th):** Private foundations, endings, roots.
*   **Pre-Peak Prep:** The period occurring *before* a Peak period often involves "preparation" or labor leading to the event.
*   **Loosing of the Bond (LB):** As noted, if the sequence hits a sign >17.5 years (Cap/Aqu, Cancer, Leo, Gemini/Virgo), it jumps to the opposite sign to complete the duration, signifying a major reversal or "break/release" in the narrative.



## PART III: THE LOOSING OF THE BOND—RUPTURE AND REVERSAL


### A. Definition and Mechanism


The **"Loosing of the Bond"** (also called the **"breaking of the sequence"**) represents one of the most dramatic and precise phenomena in classical astrology.[8][25][51][52][54]


**Definition:** When a **Zodiacal Releasing period** at Level 1 (or Level 2) extends longer than approximately 17.5 years, the sub-periods (Level 2 or Level 3) will eventually complete a full cycle through all twelve zodiacal signs and return to where they began. At this point, instead of **repeating** the sequence from the beginning, the system **jumps to the opposite sign** and continues from there. This dramatic reversal is the "Loosing of the Bond."[19][25][51][52]


**Which Signs Produce a Loosing of the Bond?**


Only the planets with **great years exceeding 17.5 years** can produce a Loosing of the Bond:[19][25][51][52]


- **Mercury:** 20 years (Gemini, Virgo)
- **Moon:** 25 years (Cancer)
- **Sun:** 19 years (Leo)
- **Saturn:** 27 years (Capricorn), 30 years (Aquarius)


Venus (8 years), Mars (15 years), and Jupiter (12 years) do NOT produce a Loosing of the Bond because their periods are shorter than 17.5 years.


### B. How the Loosing of the Bond Manifests


**Concrete Example (from Source [19][25]):**


A native has **Lot of Fortune in Cancer** (Moon's 25-year period). At Level 2, the sub-periods cycle through the zodiac in order: Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius, Pisces, Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer (completing the cycle), Leo, Virgo... 


However, when the 25-month sub-period sequence has cycled through all twelve signs once (approximately 17+ years into the main Cancer period), instead of continuing with a **second Cancer sub-period**, the system **jumps to the opposite sign (Capricorn)** and continues from there.


The sequence becomes: ...Gemini, **[LOOSING OF THE BOND]**, Capricorn, Aquarius, Pisces, etc.


**Timing:** For a 25-year Cancer period, the Loosing of the Bond occurs approximately **17 years into the period**, marking a profound threshold.[19][25][51]


### C. Astrological Significance: The Mechanism for Major Life Reversals


The Loosing of the Bond is universally understood as a **major turning point or threshold in the life**, particularly regarding the **Lot from which one is releasing.**[8][25][51][52][54]


**For Zodiacal Releasing from the Lot of Spirit** (career/life direction):


The Loosing of the Bond marks a **major career transition or fundamental shift in life direction**. Historical examples include:[51][54]


- **Arnold Schwarzenegger:** Loosing of the Bond when he transitioned from professional bodybuilding to acting, and again when he transitioned from acting to political office (California governor)
- **Venus Williams:** Loosing of the Bond periods coinciding with pivotal career decisions and competitive victories


**For Zodiacal Releasing from the Lot of Fortune** (health/circumstances):


The Loosing of the Bond marks a **dramatic shift in health status, financial circumstances, or life conditions**.[8][25][51]


**For Zodiacal Releasing from other Lots** (Eros, Nemesis, Basis):


The Loosing of the Bond marks significant transitions in the domains of **relationships, challenges, or material sustainability**, respectively.[8][25][51]


### D. The Pre-Loosing and Post-Loosing Phases


Research by contemporary astrologers has identified a **three-phase structure around the Loosing of the Bond:**[25][51]


**Phase 1—The "Foreshadowing" Period (1-2 years before):**
The sub-period immediately preceding the Loosing of the Bond—the one that will mirror or foreshadow what the Loosing of the Bond itself will bring. This period acts as a "**laying of the foundation**" phase where the themes that will crystallize in the Loosing of the Bond begin to emerge.[25][51]


**Phase 2—The Loosing of the Bond Itself (variable duration, typically 1-2 years):**
The actual threshold moment. Major life transitions occur. Decisions are made. Reversals happen. The life narrative shifts direction.[25][51]


**Phase 3—The Continuation Phase (years following):**
After the Loosing of the Bond, the new direction solidifies. The native consolidates changes and develops the new trajectory established during the Loosing of the Bond.[25][51]


**Example from Anthony Louis (Source [54]):**


The astrologer Anthony Louis received a major award for his horary astrology textbook. By analyzing Zodiacal Releasing, he found that:


- **August 1989:** Loosing of the Bond when he **submitted the book proposal** to the publisher
- **January 1991:** Another Loosing of the Bond when the **book was published**
- **April 1992:** Level 4 Loosing of the Bond (in Cancer, his 10th house of career) exactly during the week he **received the award** at the United Astrology Congress


The precision of this timing illustrates how the Loosing of the Bond functions as a **deterministic trigger for major life events**.[54]
