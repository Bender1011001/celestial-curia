# The Malefics: Saturn and Mars

3. Saturn: The Greater Malefic through the Zodiac
Saturn, the star of Kronos, is the outermost sphere, representing boundaries, time, restriction, and negation. Its delineations are universally the most severe, dealing with poverty, death, heavy labor, and structural collapse.
3.1 Saturn in the Fiery Signs (Aries, Leo, Sagittarius)
The interaction between Saturn (Cold/Dry) and the Fire signs (Hot/Dry) is viewed as particularly volatile by Abu Ma'shar and highly destructive by Firmicus.
Saturn in Aries (Fall/Depression)
* Firmicus Maternus: Saturn is here in its deiectio (fall), opposite its exaltation in Libra. Firmicus describes this as a debilitated state where Saturn's malice is uncontrolled. It decrees specific difficulties regarding patrimony and heirs. "It creates bitter hatred between siblings" and "decrees the loss of children" unless mitigated by Jupiter.7
* Abu Ma'shar: The physics here are explosive. The cold of Saturn is assaulted by the heat of Aries (ruled by Mars). Abu Ma'shar describes Saturn here as "confused and terrified," unable to perform its stabilizing function. It signifies "obstruction" and "violent constraint".2
* Rhetorius: Provides specific professional outcomes. Saturn in Aries, especially if aspected by Mars, signifies "roofers, those who walk on walls, architects, potters, or lamp makers".5 This delineation reveals the nuance of the placement: Saturn (structure/stone) + Aries (Mars/Heat/Labor) = Hard labor with stone and clay.
* Al-Biruni: Classifies this as Saturn in a "Bestial" and "Half-Voiced" sign. It signifies "underground canals, wells, old buildings, and desolate roads." It is an indicator of "ugliness, tall stature, and a sour face".6
Saturn in Leo (Detriment)
* Firmicus Maternus: Saturn is in the domicile of the Sun, its cosmic opposite (Darkness vs. Light). Firmicus notes that Saturn here causes the native to be "struck by constant envy." The native may achieve glory early in life but is prone to "early illnesses and pains in the extremities." It denies the native the ability to marry virgins or causes separation.7
* Rhetorius: Confirms the association with "architects and masons" when configured with Mars.5 The text emphasizes the "labor" aspect of Saturn in Fire signs—burning energy to build structures.
* Paulus Alexandrinus: In the Decans of Leo, Saturn rules the first face (0-10°). Here, Saturn casts a shadow over the beginning of the solar sign, introducing "heaviness" and "toil" to the otherwise regal nature of Leo.4
Saturn in Sagittarius
* Firmicus Maternus: In the house of Jupiter, Saturn is somewhat mitigated but still restrictive. It can indicate "long travels" and involvement with foreign lands or religions, often with hardship.
* Al-Biruni: Sagittarius is a "bicorporeal" sign. Saturn here affects the thighs (melothesia). It signifies "beasts of burden" and "elephants" (large, slow animals).6
* Abu Ma'shar: The mixture is Cold/Dry (Saturn) in Hot/Moist (Jupiter's sign). This is a tempering influence. Saturn here is less malicious, turning its restriction toward "codified wisdom" or "religious law" (Jupiter), though often in a dogmatic or austere manner.
3.2 Saturn in the Earthy Signs (Taurus, Virgo, Capricorn)
Here Saturn is in its element (Triplicity). The Cold/Dry nature of Saturn harmonizes with the Cold/Dry nature of the Earth signs, producing stability, accumulation, and persistence.
Saturn in Taurus
* Firmicus Maternus: Saturn here causes "continuous labors and early losses" of paternal inheritance. However, unlike in Aries, recovery is possible. "What was lost is later recovered with the increase of joy," leading to a stable old age.7
* Al-Biruni: Saturn in an Earth sign indicates "black animals," "farming," and "tillage." It signifies established wealth in the form of land or heavy commodities like lead.6
* Rhetorius: Indicates specific trades involving the earth: "miners, diggers of wells, and those who work with mud."
Saturn in Virgo
* Paulus Alexandrinus: Virgo is the "House of Hermes" (Mercury). Saturn here enters the domain of the intellect. Paulus associates this placement with "administrators" or "stewards" who manage the resources of others, often with a critical or austere eye.
* Al-Biruni: Associates this placement with "granaries" and "storage." The restrictive nature of Saturn applied to the harvest sign of Virgo suggests "hoarding" or "rationing."
Saturn in Capricorn (Domicile)
* Firmicus Maternus: This is the Thema Mundi placement of Saturn.1 Here Saturn is powerful, signifying the "first age of the world"—a time of wildness but also of primal authority. It grants "great authority," "administration of public affairs," and a "severe but just" character.
* Abu Ma'shar: The quality is pure. Excessive Cold/Dryness in a Cold/Dry sign. This creates "extreme stability" and "endurance." It represents the "master of the blockade."
* Paulus Alexandrinus: Saturn in its own house and term (specifically the first degrees) allows the native to "build foundations" that last.
3.3 Saturn in the Airy Signs (Gemini, Libra, Aquarius)
Saturn has a special relationship with the Air triplicity (ruled by Saturn by day in the Dorothean/Paulus system).
Saturn in Libra (Exaltation)
* Firmicus Maternus: Saturn is exalted at 21° Libra.8 This is the supreme position for Saturn. It signifies "judges," "great administrators," and those who "wield power over life and death." The restrictive nature of Saturn is elevated to "Justice."
* Al-Biruni: Libra is a "Human" and "Loud-Voiced" sign. Saturn here speaks with authority. It signifies "markets," "weights and measures," and "elderly statesmen".9
* Abu Ma'shar: The Warmth/Moisture of Libra (Air) perfectly balances the Cold/Dryness of Saturn. This equilibrium transforms Saturn's malice into "discipline" and "fairness."
Saturn in Aquarius (Domicile)
* Firmicus Maternus: Saturn's diurnal house. It signifies "deep knowledge," "secrets," and "fidelity." It is the sign of the "Water Bearer," but for Saturn, it represents the "pourer of time." Firmicus links this to "mysteries" and "hidden arts."
* Al-Biruni: Aquarius is "weak-voiced." Saturn here is silent, contemplating, and removed from society. It rules "desolate places" but also "scientific inquiry" (astronomy/geometry).
3.4 Saturn in the Watery Signs (Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces)
Saturn in Cancer (Detriment)
* Firmicus Maternus: Saturn is in the house of the Moon (its opposite). This is a place of "sedition," "lawsuits," and "contradictions." The native relies on their own virtue but faces "great perils" and often loses inherited wealth.7
* Al-Biruni: Cancer is "Mute" and "Fertile." Saturn here denies the fertility, causing "loss of children" or "issues with parents" (Saturn representing the father, Moon the mother). It signifies "cold waters," "drowning," or "dark depths."
* Rhetorius: Mentions "waterside jobs" but often involving "toil" or "danger."

5. Mars: The Lesser Malefic through the Zodiac
Mars (Ares) represents heat, dryness, severance, and action. Its delineations vary wildly from "heroic general" (in dignity) to "violent criminal" (in debility).
5.1 Mars in the Earthy Signs (Exaltation)
Mars in Capricorn (Exaltation)
* Firmicus Maternus: Exalted at 28° Capricorn.8 Mars here is "disciplined." It signifies "military leaders," "conquerors," and "executives" who use force with precision.
* Abu Ma'shar: The Cold of Capricorn tempers the Heat of Mars. The result is "constructive fire"—energy that builds rather than destroys.
* Al-Biruni: Signifies "wolves," "wild boars," and "tools of iron".6
Mars in Taurus (Detriment)
* Firmicus Maternus: Opposite its home in Scorpio. Mars is "sluggish" but also "stubborn." It signifies "losses through women" (Venus rules Taurus) or "scandals."
* Rhetorius: "Carpenters and artisans" when aspected by Saturn/Venus.5 The violence of Mars is turned toward "cutting" and "shaping" materials.
5.2 Mars in the Watery Signs (Fall/Triplicity)
Mars in Cancer (Fall)
* Firmicus Maternus: Mars is in its fall (opposite Capricorn). It signifies "domestic strife," "denial of sons," and "early death of parents." It is erratic and emotional.7
* Abu Ma'shar: Heat/Dryness (Mars) in Cold/Moisture (Cancer). A chaotic mixture producing "steam" (volatility). The fire is extinguished or hisses. "Like a sharp blade rusting".2
* Al-Biruni: "Water hens," "nocturnal predators." Indicates "cowardice" or "treachery" (biting from the dark).
Mars in Scorpio (Domicile)
* Firmicus Maternus: Mars's nocturnal house.1 It signifies "physicians," "surgeons," "poisoners," and "spies." The nature of Mars is "hidden" and "penetrating."
* Paulus Alexandrinus: Mars rules the first decan of Scorpio (0-10°).4 This position is pure martial intensity—"warriors" and "assassins."
5.3 Mars in the Fiery Signs
Mars in Aries (Domicile)
* Firmicus Maternus: Mars's diurnal house. "Generals," "athletes," "gladiators." High vitality but danger of "head injuries" (Aries rules the Head).
* Paulus Alexandrinus: Mars rules the first decan of Aries.4 The purest expression of the planet: unadulterated aggression and initiative.
* Rhetorius: With Saturn here, it makes "roofers" or "miners".5
Mars in Leo
* Firmicus Maternus: If in the Horoscope, "denies sons".7 It signifies "fever," "fire," and "anger of kings."
* Al-Biruni: "Lions," "predators." High military rank but danger of falling from grace.
