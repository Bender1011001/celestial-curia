The Delineation Codex: Complete Source Text Interpretations for Pre-1700 Astrology
1. Introduction: The Philological and Technical Framework
The construction of a computational astrology engine grounded in the pre-1700 tradition requires a fundamental departure from the psychological synthesis that characterizes 20th-century horoscopy. In the modern paradigm, symbols are fluid archetypes; in the Hellenistic (c. 2nd century CE) and Renaissance (c. 17th century CE) traditions, they are components of a rigid, conditional logic designed to determine specific outcomes: length of life, material fortune, rank, and the manner of death.
This report, The Delineation Codex, serves as the primary dataset for ingesting this logic. It aggregates, categorizes, and analyzes the literal interpretative strings found in the four foundational texts of the Western tradition: the Anthologies of Vettius Valens, the Tetrabiblos of Claudius Ptolemy, the Carmen Astrologicum of Dorotheus of Sidon, and Christian Astrology by William Lilly. These texts represent distinct "data streams" in the history of the craft. Valens represents the working astrologer's notebook from Alexandria, filled with raw empirical data and the "Time Lord" techniques that dominated the era.1 Ptolemy provides the Aristotelian natural philosophy, attempting to systematize astrology through the physics of optics and elemental motion.3 Dorotheus establishes the elegiac tradition of electional and natal interpretation that would form the backbone of later Persian and Arabic astrology.5 Finally, Lilly represents the culmination of the tradition, synthesizing the Arabic inheritance into Early Modern English practice.7
The methodology employed herein is strictly philological. We isolate the ipsissima verba—the very words—of the authors. Where modern intuition might suggest a "challenging emotional state," the source text may specify "violent death by water" or "poverty." For the purposes of a computational engine, these distinctions are existential. The engine must calculate dignity, sect, and aspectual condition to trigger the correct textual output. This report prioritizes the literal constraints of the source material: where a specific combination (e.g., "Saturn in Virgo") is absent from the surviving manuscript fragments available in the research corpus, it is marked "NOT FOUND IN SOURCES" to preserve the integrity of the dataset.
This document is organized to facilitate direct database entry. Part 1 maps the Celestial State (Planets in Signs), processing the Essential Dignities. Part 2 maps the Terrestrial State (Planets in Houses), processing Accidental Dignity and topic allocation. Part 3 algorithms the Aspectual logic, specifically the modification of rays by Sect (Day/Night). Part 4 provides the "Test Suite"—worked historical examples from the authors themselves to benchmark the engine's outputs.
________________
Part 1: Planets in Signs (The Celestial State)
The following dataset encompasses the 84 permutations of the seven visible planets within the twelve zodiacal signs. In the traditional ontology, a planet in a sign is not merely a filter for personality traits but a measurement of Essential Dignity—the planet's legal standing and capacity to effect its nature.
Technical Note on Source Variance:
* Valens: Generally focuses on the nature of the planet and its interaction with the sect (diurnal/nocturnal). His sign delineations are often embedded within complex configurations rather than isolated "cookbook" lists.
* Lilly: Provides rigid classifications of Dignity (Domicile, Exaltation) and Debility (Detriment, Fall). His interpretations are heavily focused on character, physical appearance, and social standing.
* Ptolemy: Focuses on the elemental mixture (hot, cold, wet, dry) produced by the planet in a specific zodiacal environment.
* Dorotheus: Often utilizes the triplicity lords to judge the overall success of the planet.

	________________
Part 3: Aspects with Sect Modulation
The traditional aspect is not merely an angle; it is a line of sight (aspectus). Planets "behold" or "cast rays" at one another. The interpretation of these rays is heavily modified by Sect—whether the chart is Diurnal (Day) or Nocturnal (Night).
The Opposition (180°)
* General Meaning: "They are enemies by opposition of Houses." 12 This aspect represents separation, confrontation, and open enmity. It is the nature of Saturn (which opposes the lights in the Thema Mundi).
* By Day (Diurnal): "The Sun is the leader of the Day... if Mars [out of sect] is reaching the place in which Jupiter or the Sun was by day... it is worse for this [native] and more difficult in its maleficence." 18
* By Night (Nocturnal): "Saturn [out of sect] reaching the place in which the Moon was by night... is difficult." 18
The Square (90°)
* General Meaning: "Quartile aspect... indicates intense activity, struggle, and friction." 35 "Malefic Squares... are generally difficult if the malefic is in a whole sign opposition or square to its natal position." 18
* Valens' Specific: "Valens says you may be an adulterer, lecher... if: Your Venus is conjunct or square Mars." 24
The Trine (120°)
* General Meaning: "Aspect of trines... indicates harmony and ease." 35 "It is good when a malefic (Saturn or Mars) is in a whole sign trine to its natal position." 18
* Benefic Context: "The benefic stars which are appropriately and favorably situated [e.g., trine] bring about their proper effects according to their own nature." 36
The Sextile (60°)
* General Meaning: "Aspect of the planets from sextile." 35 Generally weaker than the trine but of the same nature (Venereal).
* Lilly's View: "Jupiter or Venus cast not some Sextile or Trine to the Lord of the Ascendant... for that is an argument that either Medicine or Strength of Nature will contradict that malignant influence." 29
The Conjunction (0°)
* General Meaning: "Conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter... marks subperiods in history." 37 The effect depends entirely on the nature of the planets involved (Bodily Union).
* Benefic + Malefic: "If Venus is conjunct Saturn... Valens says you marry below your station and are caused grief in marriage." 24
* Sect Modification: "Transit of Out of Sect Malefic to Natal Sect Light or Benefic is Difficult." 18

Part 4: Worked Historical Examples
To benchmark the computational engine, we utilize two complete case studies preserved in the source texts. These examples demonstrate the application of the rules (Time Lords, Directions) in a live setting.
Case Study I: The Emperor Nero
Source: Vettius Valens, Anthology (Reconstructed from 38)
* Birth Data: December 15, 37 AD, Sunrise. Rome, Italy.
* Key Positions:
   * Sun: Sagittarius (approx. 22°).
   * Moon: Leo (approx. 27°), waning.
   * Ascendant: Sagittarius.
   * Saturn: Cancer (26°).
   * Mars: Sagittarius (25°).
   * Jupiter: Scorpio.
* Valens' Analysis:
   * Valens uses this chart (without naming Nero, likely for political safety) to demonstrate the "crisis of the 31st year" (68 AD, the year of Nero's suicide).
   * The Configuration: "The Moon is square Jupiter at the unnamed man's birth... The sun is square Saturn at his birth." 38
   * The Prediction of Death: Valens notes that at the time of death (June 11, 68 AD), the planets returned to the same difficult configurations (Profection/Transit). "The moon is once again square Jupiter at his death... The sun is square Saturn... Venus is trine Saturn at his birth. She is once again trine Saturn at his death." 38
   * Outcome: "He brings about violent deaths by water, or by strangulation, or through imprisonment... He is the star of Nemesis." 13 (Valens' general delineation of Saturn applies here to the specific outcome of Nero's demise).
Case Study II: The English Merchant
Source: William Lilly, Christian Astrology, Book 3 41
* Context: Lilly provides a comprehensive analysis of the Nativity of an English Merchant to demonstrate the calculation of the Hyleg (Giver of Life) and Alcocoden (Giver of Years).
* Method:
   * Lilly uses "primary directions" to predict the merchant's life events.
   * Rectification: Lilly rectifies the chart using the "Trutine of Hermes" and "Animodar". 42
   * Prediction: He directs the Ascendant and Midheaven to the terms and aspects of the planets.
   * Wealth Judgement: Lilly analyzes the 2nd house. "If you find the Planets all angular [in the 2nd], it's one good Signe of Substance." 33
   * Outcome: The merchant's chart is used to predict "more than twenty years of forecasts, up to the time that Lilly judged to be the end of the man's natural life." 41
________________
Appendix: Glossarial Index of Technical Terminology
* Alcocoden: The planet that governs the years of the life, determined by the Hyleg.
* Anareta: The "killing" planet or destroyer of life.
* Hyleg: The "Giver of Life" (Prorogator).
* Hayz: A condition of strength where a diurnal planet is in a diurnal sign above the earth by day (or nocturnal planet/sign/below earth by night).
* Sect: The division of planets into Day (Sun, Jupiter, Saturn) and Night (Moon, Venus, Mars). Mercury is common.
* Terms (Bounds): Unequal divisions of a sign ruled by the five non-luminary planets; essential for primary directions and determining the specific quality of a planet's action.
