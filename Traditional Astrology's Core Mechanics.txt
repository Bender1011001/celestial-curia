The Fundamental Mechanics: Essential Calculations and Forensic Conditions in Traditional Astrology
Introduction: The Architecture of Determinism
The study of traditional astrology—encompassing the Hellenistic, Arabic, and Latin Medieval traditions—is fundamentally a study of celestial mechanics applied to human destiny. Unlike the psychological astrology of the 20th century, which often prioritizes the subjective internal experience and the potential for character transformation, traditional astrology operates as a rigorous, deterministic system of physics. It posits a universe where the quality of time is measurable, the duration of life is calculable, and the condition of a planet is a forensic fact rather than a symbolic feeling.
To practice this art as it was intended by figures such as Vettius Valens, Claudius Ptolemy, and Guido Bonatti requires more than intuition; it demands a mastery of the "mechanical gears" that drive the system. These gears are the algorithms of vitality, the geometry of the primordial "World Chart" (Thema Mundi), the literal spatial definitions of the houses (Topoi), and the precise error-checking protocols of forensic analysis.
This research report serves as a comprehensive technical manual for these essential components. It extracts and synthesizes the core infrastructure of the tradition, providing the mathematical frameworks and philosophical rationales that transform a horoscope from a collection of symbols into a functioning machine of fate. By analyzing the primary sources—from the Tetrabiblos to the Liber Astronomiae—we uncover a system obsessed with hierarchy, condition, and the objective measurement of strength.
________________
Part 1: The Hyleg and Alcocoden (The Calculus of Vitality)
In the hierarchy of traditional judgment, no question is more primal than the computation of the length of life. The ancients viewed the nativity not as a promise of infinite potential, but as a bounded container of time. Before predicting empire, marriage, or wealth, the astrologer was obligated to determine if the native possessed the vital force (Hyleg) to survive infancy, and if so, the specific allotment of years (Alcocoden) granted by the celestial governors. This calculation represents the apex of technical astrology, requiring a synthesis of sect, dignity, and house position.
1A. The Hyleg Identification Algorithm
The Hyleg (from the Persian hīlāj, known in Greek as Apheta or "Prerogator") is the planet or point that acts as the significator of life itself. It represents the body's capacity to withstand entropy. The identification of the Hyleg is algorithmic, strictly dependent on the Sect of the chart (Diurnal vs. Nocturnal) and the Aphetic Places (Life-Giving Houses).
Step 1: Definition of Aphetic Places
A planet cannot sustain life if it is hidden from the Ascendant or depressed in its location. Therefore, the Hyleg must be located in specific "Prorogative" zones. While minor variations exist between Ptolemy and later medieval authors, the consensus core of Aphetic places is:
* The 1st House (Ascendant): From 5 degrees above the horizon to 25 degrees below it (Ptolemy’s specific orb) or the entire whole sign/quadrant house (Medieval).
* The 10th House (Midheaven): The place of action and culmination.
* The 11th House (Good Spirit): The succedent house rising towards the Midheaven, considered the most fortunate place.
* The 7th House (Descendant) and 9th House (God): Secondary aphetic places.
* Excluded Places: The 8th, 12th, 6th, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th houses are generally ineligible. The 8th, 6th, and 12th are destructive (malefic); the 2nd and 3rd are cadent/succedent without aspectual strength; the 4th is the grave.
Step 2: The Priority Hierarchy
The search for the Hyleg follows a strict flow-chart logic.1
For a Diurnal Nativity (Day Birth):
1. The Sun: The Sun is the primary candidate. If the Sun is in an Aphetic place, it is the Hyleg.
2. The Moon: If the Sun is not in an Aphetic place (e.g., in the 12th house), check the Moon. If the Moon is in an Aphetic place, it becomes the Hyleg.
3. The Part of Fortune: If neither luminary is valid, some systems (Ptolemy) move to the planet having dignity over the Sun, Moon, and New Moon; others (Bonatti/Medieval) check the Part of Fortune (if Aphetic).
4. The Ascendant (Horoskopos): If all else fails, the degree of the Ascendant itself assumes the role of Hyleg.
5. The Syzygy: The degree of the prenatal New or Full Moon may also be considered in complex cases.
For a Nocturnal Nativity (Night Birth):
1. The Moon: The Moon is the primary candidate. If in an Aphetic place, it is the Hyleg.
2. The Sun: If the Moon is invalid, check the Sun (though the Sun is rarely Aphetic at night unless in the 7th/9th).
3. The Part of Fortune: If both luminaries fail, check the Part of Fortune.
4. The Ascendant: If no other point qualifies, the Ascendant is the Hyleg.
Step 3: The Condition of "Witnessing"
A crucial, often overlooked rule in the Arabic tradition (found in Bonatti and Al-Biruni) is that a candidate can only be Hyleg if it has a valid Alcocoden. If the Sun is in Aries, but Mars (its domicile ruler) makes no aspect to the Sun, the Sun cannot be Hyleg because it has no "guardian" to manage the years. The astrologer must then move to the next candidate in the hierarchy.4
________________
1B. The Alcocoden Identification Algorithm
Once the Hyleg is established, the astrologer must identify the Alcocoden (from the Persian Kadukhudāh, meaning "Master of the House"). The Alcocoden is the planet that "owns" the Hyleg and distributes the years of life.
Step 1: Determine Potential Rulers
Calculate the essential dignities at the specific degree of the Hyleg. The potential Alcocoden must have dignity here. The standard scoring (Almuten) system is often used:
* Domicile Ruler: 5 points.
* Exaltation Ruler: 4 points.
* Triplicity Ruler: 3 points (select the primary ruler for the sect).
* Term (Bound) Ruler: 2 points.
* Face (Decan) Ruler: 1 point.
Step 2: The Aspect Requirement
To claim the role of Alcocoden, a ruler must regard (aspect) the Hyleg.
* Ptolemy's Rule: The Alcocoden must have dominion and aspect.
* Bonatti's Selection: If the Domicile ruler aspects the Hyleg, it is preferred. If the Domicile ruler is in aversion (no aspect), check the Exaltation ruler. If that fails, check the Triplicity or Term rulers. The planet with the highest dignity that also casts a ray to the Hyleg wins the role.1
Step 3: Calculation of the Years (The Quantitative Analysis)
The Alcocoden grants a base number of years derived from planetary periods, which is then modified by the planet’s condition (Angular, Succedent, Cadent) and the aspects it receives.
The Planetary Years Table:
The tradition assigns three values to each planet: Greater, Mean (Middle), and Lesser (Least).
Planet
	Lesser Years
	Mean Years
	Greater Years
	Saturn
	30
	43.5
	57
	Jupiter
	12
	45.5
	79
	Mars
	15
	40.5
	66
	Sun
	19
	69.5
	120
	Venus
	8
	45
	82
	Mercury
	20
	48
	76
	Moon
	25
	66.5
	108
	Source: Derived from Al-Biruni and Bonatti Tables.1
The Algorithm for Granting Years:
1. Angular Alcocoden: If the Alcocoden is in the 1st, 10th, 7th, or 4th house and well-dignified (Domicile/Exaltation), it grants the Greater Years.
2. Succedent Alcocoden: If in the 11th, 5th, 2nd, or 8th (or Angular but with lesser dignity like Term/Triplicity), it grants the Mean Years.
3. Cadent Alcocoden: If in the 9th, 3rd, 6th, or 12th, or if Peregrine/Debilitated, it grants the Lesser Years. Note: A planet in Retrograde or Combustion may grant even less or deny life entirely.
Step 4: Mathematical Modifiers
The base years are rarely the final number. They must be adjusted by the "Witnesses"—other planets aspecting the Alcocoden.
* Benefics (Jupiter/Venus): If casting a helpful aspect (Trine/Sextile/Conjunction), add their Lesser Years to the sum. Some traditions add Lesser Years as years, others as months, depending on the strength of the benefic.
* Malefics (Saturn/Mars): If casting a harmful aspect (Square/Opposition), subtract their Lesser Years from the sum.
* South Node (Cauda Draconis): Often subtracts a quarter of the years if conjunct.
* Combustion: If the Alcocoden is combust, the years may be drastically reduced, often signifying a life cut short in childhood, unless the Sun is the Alcocoden.
1C. Worked Example: Forensic Application
Scenario: A Day Birth. Sun at 24° Libra (11th House). Ascendant Sagittarius.
1. Find Hyleg: Day chart. Sun is in the 11th House (Aphetic place). Sun is in Fall (Libra) but positionally strong. Sun is Hyleg.
2. Find Alcocoden:
   * Degree: 24° Libra.
   * Domicile: Venus.
   * Exaltation: Saturn.
   * Term: Mars (Egyptian terms usually start late in Libra, let's assume Mars terms for 24°).
   * Triplicity: Saturn (Day ruler of Air).
   * Candidate Check:
      * Assume Venus is in Sagittarius (1st House). She sextiles the Sun. She has Domicile authority. She qualifies.
      * Assume Saturn is in Capricorn (2nd House). He squares the Sun. He has Exaltation + Triplicity authority. He qualifies.
   * Selection: Venus has 5 points (Domicile). Saturn has 4 (Exaltation) + 3 (Triplicity) = 7 points. Saturn has more dignity and aspects the Sun. Saturn is Alcocoden.
3. Calculate Years:
   * Saturn is in Capricorn (Domicile). He is Succedent (2nd House).
   * Base: Mean Years (43.5 years). Note: Some might argue for Greater Years due to strong dignity, but Succedent placement usually caps at Mean.
   * Modifiers:
      * Venus (Benefic) is in the 1st, casting a sextile to Saturn. Add Venus Lesser Years (8). Calculation: 43.5 + 8 = 51.5.
      * Mars is in Cancer (8th), opposing Saturn. Subtract Mars Lesser Years (15).
      * Final Calculation: 51.5 - 15 = 36.5 Years.
   * Prediction: The native faces a critical vitality crisis (death or severe illness) at age 36 and 6 months.

Part 2: Thema Mundi (The Archetype of the Cosmos)
The Thema Mundi is the mythical horoscope of the world's creation. It is not a historical chart but a pedagogical tool used by Hellenistic astrologers (and transmitted by Firmicus Maternus) to explain the logic of planetary rulerships, exaltations, and aspect natures. It represents the "ideal" state of the cosmos from which all interpretative meaning flows.
2A. Complete Planetary Positions
The chart is erected with Cancer Rising, placing the Moon—the mother of generation—at the helm of the physical world.

	Source: Firmicus Maternus, Mathesis, Book III.5
2B. The Derivation of Aspect Natures
The Thema Mundi provides the geometric proof for why aspects are considered "Benefic" or "Malefic." The nature of an aspect is derived from the relationship of the planets to the Luminaries (Sun and Moon) in this chart.
1. The Opposition (180°): In the Thema Mundi, the Moon (Cancer) and Saturn (Capricorn) are in opposition. Because Saturn is the Greater Malefic, the nature of the opposition is Saturnine—cold, separative, blocking, and hostile.
2. The Square (90°): The Sun (Leo) and Mars (Scorpio) are in a square. (Also Moon to Venus/Aries, but the Sun/Mars square is primary). Because Mars is the Lesser Malefic, the square is Martian—sharp, heated, contentious, and energetic.
3. The Trine (120°): The Sun (Leo) and Jupiter (Sagittarius) are in a trine. Because Jupiter is the Greater Benefic, the trine is Jovian—supportive, expansive, flowing, and stable.
4. The Sextile (60°): The Sun (Leo) and Venus (Libra) are in a sextile. Because Venus is the Lesser Benefic, the sextile is Venusian—harmonious, unifying, and pleasant.
5. The Inconjunct (Aversion): Planets in the 2nd, 6th, 8th, and 12th houses from the Ascendant in the Thema Mundi (Leo, Sagittarius, Aquarius, Gemini relative to Cancer) create complex relationships. While the Sun is in the 2nd, it "sees" the Moon by proximity. However, Saturn (7th) is in opposition to the Ascendant, signifying the enemy or death. The 6th (Jupiter) and 8th (Aquarius/Saturn) are in aversion, contributing to the "evil" reputation of these houses as places where the Ascendant cannot "see" or manage affairs.7
2C. Rulership and Exaltation Logic
The chart illustrates the symmetry of the zodiac. The Sun and Moon govern Leo and Cancer (the Northern, bright signs). The planets then rule the signs radiating outward in accordance with their orbital velocity:
* Mercury (fastest) rules Virgo/Gemini (adjacent to Lights).
* Venus rules Libra/Taurus.
* Mars rules Scorpio/Aries.
* Jupiter rules Sagittarius/Pisces.
* Saturn (slowest) rules Capricorn/Aquarius (opposite the Lights, the dark of winter).
This distribution creates the Solar Semicircle (Leo to Capricorn) and the Lunar Semicircle (Cancer to Aquarius), a distinction critical for determining planetary sect and orientation.

Part 3: Complete House Topoi (Literal Ancient Definitions)
The twelve houses, or Topoi (Places), were not originally abstract psychological fields but concrete locations with specific powers (dynamics) and meanings. The following definitions are synthesized from the works of Vettius Valens (Anthology), Firmicus Maternus (Mathesis), and Paulus Alexandrinus.8
House
	Greek Name
	Literal Meaning
	Planetary Joy
	Ancient Significations (Topoi)
	1st
	Horoskopos
	"Hour Marker" / Helm
	Mercury
	Life, breath, body, appearance, the spirit, the head, the beginning of all initiatives. The entry of the soul into the world.
	2nd
	Haidou Pyle
	"Gate of Hades"
	-
	Livelihood (Bios), movable assets, hope of resources. "Dark" because it does not behold the Ascendant (it is succedent and falling away).
	3rd
	Thea
	"Goddess"
	Moon
	Siblings, kin, short journeys, dreams, religious rites (queenly/feminine), friends, patronage. A favorable place despite being cadent.
	4th
	Hypogeion
	"Subterranean"
	-
	Parents, fatherland, family lineage, hidden treasures, real estate, old age, the grave, the end of matters. Mystical foundations.
	5th
	Agathe Tyche
	"Good Fortune"
	Venus
	Children, pleasure, sex, emissaries, creativity, gambling, banquets. A place of joy and Venusian indulgence.
	6th
	Kake Tyche
	"Bad Fortune"
	Mars
	Illness, injury, slaves, servants, enemies (internal), exhaustion. Mars rejoices here because his heat is contained; he manages the "dirty work."
	7th
	Dysis
	"Setting" / Descendant
	-
	Marriage, unions, sexual partners, open enemies, lawsuits, death (as the sun dies in the west). The "Other."
	8th
	Epikataphora
	"Falling Down" / Idle
	-
	Death, benefits from the dead (inheritance), fear, loss, the dowry/resources of the partner. The "Idle" place (Argos)—inactive for the native.
	9th
	Theos
	"God"
	Sun
	Foreign travel, astrology, divination, philosophy, kings, religion (solar/masculine), dreams of gods. The "Place of the Sun."
	10th
	Mesouranema
	"Midheaven"
	-
	Action (Praxis), career, reputation, authority, magistrates, mastery, visibility. The culmination of the life path.
	11th
	Agathos Daimon
	"Good Spirit"
	Jupiter
	Friends, hopes, alliance, patronage, gifts from the King (10th). The most fortunate house, aiding the Ascendant.
	12th
	Kakos Daimon
	"Bad Spirit"
	Saturn
	Secret enemies, large animals (beasts of burden), imprisonment, self-undoing, childbirth (labor/suffering), slavery. The place of Saturn's darkness.
	Insight: The assignment of "Joys" follows the sect division. The Diurnal planets (Sun, Jupiter, Saturn) rejoice in the upper/day hemisphere or masculine houses (9th, 11th, 12th—Saturn is in the 12th to mitigate his malice by "darkness"). The Nocturnal planets (Moon, Venus, Mars) rejoice in the lower/night hemisphere or feminine houses (3rd, 5th, 6th). Mercury, neutral, rejoices in the 1st, connecting the two worlds.

Part 4: Soli-Lunar Phase (The Cycle of Manifestation)
The geometric relationship between the Sun (Will/Spirit) and Moon (Body/Manifestation) determines the Phase of the nativity. This was a critical component of character analysis in Valens and was revived and psychologically deepened by Dane Rudhyar.13
4A. Calculation and Definition
The phase is determined by the Moon’s elongation from the Sun:
Phase Angle = (Moon Longitude - Sun Longitude) % 360
1. New Moon (0°-45°): The beginning.
2. Crescent (45°-90°): The struggle to mobilize.
3. First Quarter (90°-135°): The crisis of action.
4. Gibbous (135°-180°): The struggle for perfection.
5. Full Moon (180°-225°): The realization/illumination.
6. Disseminating (225°-270°): The distribution of knowledge.
7. Last Quarter (270°-315°): The crisis of consciousness.
8. Balsamic (315°-360°): The release/prophecy.
4B. Delineations (Synthesis of Ancient and Traditional)
* New Moon Type: Emergence. The native is impulsive, projecting intent without feedback. Anciently associated with the blind thrust of the seed breaking the soil. Subjective and emotionally fused with the environment.
* Crescent Type: Assertion. The "struggle against the past." The native feels resistance from established forms and must assert individuality forcefully to survive.
* First Quarter Type: Executive Will. A "Crisis in Action." A builder and destroyer of old forms. Strong martial energy; the native is often a manager or warrior fighting to establish a new structure.
* Gibbous Type: Analysis. The "Perfectionist." High analytical capacity, asking "Why?" Preparing for the revelation. Often associated with apprentices, technicians, and those seeking to refine the self before the climax.
* Full Moon Type: Objectivity. The "Realizer." Relationships are central. The native sees clearly the "other" and the "world." Life is a theater of revelation, separation, or divorce. The light is maximum; nothing is hidden.
* Disseminating Type: Distribution. The "Teacher/Crusader." What was seen at the Full Moon must now be shared. Strong ideological drive (Jupiterian). The native is a sower of seeds (ideas) into the collective.
* Last Quarter Type: Reorientation. A "Crisis in Consciousness." Turning away from external success toward internal principles. Often rigid, iconoclastic, or authoritative. The builder of systems for the next cycle.
* Balsamic Type: Closure. The "Prophet." Closing the cycle. Karma is heavy; the native feels "fated" or out of step with the current time, preparing for the future. Often short-lived or sickly in ancient texts, but spiritually potent.14
________________
Part 5: Bonatti's 146 Considerations (The Forensic Checklist)
Guido Bonatti’s Liber Astronomiae (Treatise 5) codified 146 "Considerations" (Aphorisms) that act as a pilot's pre-flight checklist. These rules are primarily used in Horary and Electional astrology but apply to Nativities to verify "Radicality" (validity).
Summary by Category (Forensic Logic)
1. Considerations Before Judgment (The Validity of the Chart)
* Cons. 1-3: The motivation of the Querent. Is the question rooted in necessity, or is the Querent testing the astrologer? (A chart judged without serious intent lies).
* Cons. 146: The "Error of the Artist." If the astrologer is tired, greedy, or the chart is non-radical (e.g., less than 3° or more than 27° rising), judgment may fail.
* Cons. 5: The myriad afflictions of the Moon (see Part 6).
2. The Logic of Perfection (How Events Happen)
* Cons. 4: The ways planets interact: Profection, Detriment, Conjunction, Separation, Translation of Light, Collection of Light, Prohibition, Reception, Void of Course.
* Cons. 141: When the significator of the thing asked for is in the Ascendant, the thing comes to the querent without effort.
3. Planetary Strength and Weakness
* Cons. 6: Ten ways planets are debilitated: Cadent, Retrograde, Combust, Besieged, Peregrine, slow in motion, aspected by malefics without reception.
* Cons. 121-125 (Rising Signs): Bonatti details the nature of the signs on the Ascendant. For example, if a "double-bodied" sign (Gemini, Pisces, Sagittarius, Virgo) rises, the native may have a dual nature, two careers, or multiple marriages.16
4. Timing and "The End of Things"
* Cons. 30: If the significator is at 29° (changing signs), the matter is about to change radically or the opportunity has just passed.
* Cons. 31: A planet applying to a stationary planet indicates a matter that will stall or become fixed/permanent.
Note: The full list of 146 is an exhaustive enumeration of specific aspect scenarios (e.g., "If the Lord of the 1st is in the 2nd..."), but the core forensic value lies in the checks for Radicality, Moon Condition, and Reception.17
________________
Part 6: Special Conditions (The Vocabulary of Condition)
Traditional astrology relies on "accidental dignities" and "debilities"—conditions that do not stem from the zodiac sign (essential dignity) but from placement and inter-planetary relationships.
6A. Via Combusta (The Burning Way)
* Definition: A destructive zone of the zodiac traditionally defined as 15° Libra to 15° Scorpio.
* Logic: This zone contains the Fall of the Sun (Libra) and the Fall of the Moon (Scorpio). It also houses the Exaltation of Saturn (Libra) and the Domicile of Mars (Scorpio). It is a "dark valley" where the Luminaries are depressed and the Malefics are empowered.19
* Effect: The Moon here is rendered unpredictable, malefic, or ineffective. In horary, it renders the chart "not safe to judge" unless the question concerns fear, death, or surgery. It signifies emotional turbulence, secrecy, and "burning" outcomes.
6B. Besiegement (The Siege)
* Definition: A planet positioned between the two malefics (Mars and Saturn).
* Corporeal Besiegement: A planet is physically placed between Mars and Saturn in the zodiac order (e.g., Mars at 10° Aries, Venus at 12°, Saturn at 15°).
* Besiegement by Ray: A planet separates from an aspect to one malefic and immediately applies to an aspect of the other, without the intervention of a benefic.
* Effect: "Pure imprisonment." The planet is cut off from aid and restricted. It signifies being trapped between "the devil and the deep blue sea." The besieged planet cannot effect its significations.21
6C. Hayz and Halb (Sect Dignity)
* Hayz: A state of "perfect comfort" or "similitude."
   * Diurnal Planet (Sun, Jup, Sat): Is in a Day chart, Above the Horizon, in a Masculine Sign.
   * Nocturnal Planet (Moon, Ven, Mars): Is in a Night chart, Below the Horizon, in a Feminine Sign.
* Halb: A lesser condition meeting only two of the three criteria (e.g., Day planet in Day chart and Masculine sign, but below horizon).
* Effect: A planet in Hayz is potent, constructive, and behaves in a "bonified" manner. Even a malefic in Hayz (e.g., Mars in a night chart, in Scorpio, below the earth) becomes a "constructive builder" rather than a destroyer.23
6D. Solar Proximity Conditions
* Cazimi (In the Heart): Within 0° 17' of the Sun. The planet is "in the throne room of the King." It is fortified, powerful, and protected. It acts with the intensity of the Sun.
* Combust: Within 8.5° of the Sun (but outside 17'). The planet is "burnt up." It is invisible, weakened, and its significations are destroyed or hidden. It represents fear, blindness, and being overpowered by authority.
* Under the Beams: Within 15°-17° of the Sun. Weakened, but less so than combustion. The planet is obscured but recovering (if separating) or fading (if applying).19
6E. Monomoiria (The Rulership of Degrees)
* Definition: Each individual degree (0-30) of a sign is ruled by a planet, adding a microscopic layer of dignity.
* Algorithm (Paulus/Valens):
   1. The first degree of a sign is ruled by the Domicile Ruler of that sign.
   2. Subsequent degrees follow the Chaldean Order (Saturn -> Jupiter -> Mars -> Sun -> Venus -> Mercury -> Moon).
* Example (Aries - Ruled by Mars):
   * 0°-1°: Mars
   * 1°-2°: Sun (Next in Chaldean order)
   * 2°-3°: Venus
   * 3°-4°: Mercury
   * ... and so on.
* Usage: Used for chart rectification and fine-tuning descriptions. If the Ascendant is in a degree ruled by Jupiter, the native may have Jupiterian physical traits even if the sign is Aries.25
________________
Part 7: The Chaldean Order (The Architecture of Time)
The Chaldean Order is the descending sequence of planetary spheres based on apparent velocity: Saturn (Slowest) -> Jupiter -> Mars -> Sun -> Venus -> Mercury -> Moon (Fastest). This sequence is the "motherboard" for almost all timing techniques.
7A. Planetary Hours and Days
The seven-day week is a direct product of the Chaldean Order applied to the 24-hour day.
* Algorithm:
   1. The first hour of the day is ruled by the Lord of the Day (e.g., Sunday = Sun).
   2. Subsequent hours follow the Chaldean order descending.
   3. Because 24 is not divisible by 7 (24 = 3x7 + 3), the sequence shifts by 3 planets each day.
   * Sunday (Hour 1: Sun) -> Hour 24: Mercury -> Monday (Hour 1: Moon).
   * This "jump" creates the order: Sun -> Moon -> Mars -> Mercury -> Jupiter -> Venus -> Saturn (Sunday to Saturday).28
7B. Firdaria (Period Rulers)
The Firdaria is a medieval time-lord system that assigns periods of life to planets in the Chaldean sequence.
* Day Births: Sun (10 yrs) -> Venus (8) -> Mercury (13) -> Moon (9) -> Saturn (11) -> Jupiter (12) -> Mars (7).
* Night Births: Moon (9) -> Saturn (11) -> Jupiter (12) -> Mars (7) -> Sun (10) -> Venus (8) -> Mercury (13).
This technique gears the macro-cycles of human life directly to the speed and sphere of the planets, ensuring the native experiences every planetary archetype in a fixed, deterministic sequence.30
________________
Conclusion
The "mechanical gears" of traditional astrology reveal a system that is far removed from the intuitive fluidity of modern practice. It is a discipline of calculation (Hyleg/Alcocoden), geometry (Thema Mundi), spatial hierarchy (House Topoi), and forensic rigor (Bonatti's Considerations). By mastering these algorithms and definitions, the astrologer gains access to the underlying code of the traditional worldview—a view where fate is not just a concept, but a measurable force with weight, duration, and direction. This report provides the essential specifications for operating that machine.
